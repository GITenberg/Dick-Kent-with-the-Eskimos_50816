<h1 title="">DICK KENT WITH THE ESKIMOS</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE WHALEBONE SPEAR</span></h2>
<p>Muffled from head to foot in hooded caribou
shirts and bearskin trousers, five persons slowly
plodded across a vast tundra within the Arctic Circle.
Many days, by land and by boat from the Canadian
coast, had brought them to a point where they must
go on with dogs only. And now as they drove twelve
big huskies to a long sledge filled with supplies, all
armed with rifles and two with revolvers, the fur-clad
figures presented a grim appearance upon the
snowy bosom of that frozen wasteland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>A hood rimmed with blue fox fur almost completely
hid the face of the athletic figure breaking
through the snow at the head of the dog team. But
one who knew him would have had little trouble in
identifying that graceful, swinging step as belonging
to Dick Kent. He it was&mdash;again on the adventure
trail, his dark, clear eyes shining and eager behind
the smoked glasses he wore to protect his sight
from the glare of the snow-reflected sun, which,
though it was midday, hung low on the southern
horizon, a ball of baleful red.</p>
<p>Bringing up the rear were Sandy McClaren,
Dick&rsquo;s chum, and the Canadian Indian boy, Toma, an
inseparable of the two American lads since they first
had entered the north on a visit with Sandy&rsquo;s Uncle
Walter, a Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company factor. The remaining
two of the travelers were big men, alert
and vigorous, whose very appearance showed that
they represented the authority of law and justice.
They were officers of the Royal Northwest Mounted
Police, and under their furs reposed important orders
bearing the King&rsquo;s seal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Dick!&rdquo; Sandy McClaren&rsquo;s shout sounded
startlingly loud and high in the icy air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better take a rest while I break trail,&rdquo; called
the young Scotchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not tired,&rdquo; declared Dick, but nevertheless
he dropped back behind the dog team, whose lolling,
red tongues revealed how difficult was the going.</p>
<p>Sandy started forward to take Dick&rsquo;s place, but
before he could pass the huge Eskimo dog in the
lead, one of the policemen had overtaken him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young fellows have been doing too much
of this trail breaking,&rdquo; sang out Corporal Lake
McCarthy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Sandy was only too glad to give way to the big
officer, and he quickly dropped back with Dick,
where the heavy sledge, loaded with supplies, packed
the snow and made snowshoeing comparatively
easy.</p>
<p>For a time the chums trudged on without speaking,
then, while they were passing a ridge of ice,
which had been carved by wind and sun into queer
patterns, Dick gave voice to a conviction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, this looks as if it was going to be a dull
trip. Here we&rsquo;ve been mushing north for a month
and we haven&rsquo;t seen anything more dangerous than
caribou, ptarmigans and snowshoe rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too sure just yet,&rdquo; said Sandy.
&ldquo;Uncle Walter was half a mind not to let us go on
this trip. You know there was something dangerous
in the wind or he wouldn&rsquo;t have felt that way about
it. I asked him why the policemen were being sent
up here, but he just kind of laughed and said, &lsquo;Oh,
nothing,&rsquo; like he meant it was a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they talked, the boys were bent over their
snowshoes, and did not instantly notice a shirring
sound followed by the muffled plunk of an object
striking the packs on the sledge with considerable
force. The first either knew anything unusual had
occurred was when Dick chanced to glance up and
caught sight of something protruding from the
packs and the rear of the sledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the team!&rdquo; cried Dick excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s booming command was followed
by a brief tangle of snarling dogs, then the
sledge came to a dead stop. All the members of
the party gathered about Dick Kent, who was pulling
something from the packs.</p>
<p>What he at last succeeded in extracting was a
short, barbed spear, the head made of whalebone
lashed to a smooth spruce handle with reindeer sinews.
The weapon evidently had been thrown from
the top of the ice ridge alongside which they had
been sledging, and what was even clearer, the spear
arm of the hidden enemy had been exceedingly
powerful and well-trained. Instinctively, almost, all
eyes were lifted to the brow of the ridge, and the
policemen drew their pistols. But nothing was to be
seen save the barren crest of the icy hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up and take a look around,&rdquo; Corporal
McCarthy spoke briskly. &ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; he turned to the
other officer, &ldquo;you stay here. It&rsquo;s possible this fellow
was an Eskimo, but again it may be one of the
renegade Taku Indians that were reported as far
north as this. I&rsquo;ll be back pretty quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the big policeman drew a 30.30 rifle
from the sledge lashing and started up the icy slope
of the ridge. The others silently watched him disappear
over the summit. At any moment they
expected to hear the report of a rifle. But the
minutes ticked by and all remained silent. At first
they were relieved, then their fears mounted. It was
possible that whoever had thrown the spear had other
deadly weapons at his disposal. If Corporal McCarthy
were ambushed&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks like I might be right about what
I said a while ago,&rdquo; Sandy finally turned and said
to Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That spear <i>did</i> take the words out of my mouth,&rdquo;
admitted Dick, &ldquo;but we can&rsquo;t be sure yet. Anyway,
this is the first bit of excitement we&rsquo;ve had on this
freezing trip.&rdquo; He shivered a little as he looked at
the spear. &ldquo;Whew! That thing didn&rsquo;t miss me
more than four feet!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;His aim
must have been for you and me, Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like him Eskimo spear.&rdquo; The low, throaty
voice was that of Toma, who had so faithfully stood
by Dick and Sandy on their previous adventures in
the north. The boys turned to find the young
Indian examining the weapon carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eskimos!&rdquo; The magic word leaped to the lips
of Dick and Sandy almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>Dick called to the policeman, who was repairing a
trace on the dog harness. &ldquo;Mr. Sloan, when are
we going to see some Eskimos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be long, lad, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Constable Jim
Sloan&rsquo;s statement was cut off by a loud shout from
the top of the ridge. All eyes were turned upward,
and Dick and Sandy whistled. Bearing down upon
them was Corporal McCarthy accompanied by a
strange figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like you boys&rsquo;ll see an Eskimo sooner
than I thought,&rdquo; resumed Constable Sloan, as he
watched the Corporal draw nearer with a small man,
swathed in furs, walking a little ahead at the point of
the officer&rsquo;s rifle. It was apparent that a captive had
been taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got him easy,&rdquo; called the Corporal as he came
up. &ldquo;He was hiding behind a lump of ice and
thought I&rsquo;d pass him by. He&rsquo;s an Innuit alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; Sandy turned to Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innuits is what the Eskimos call themselves,&rdquo;
replied Dick, eyeing the captive curiously. &ldquo;It
means &lsquo;the people.&rsquo; I read a lot about the Eskimos
in school. Look, he has another spear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All now gathered about the policeman, listening
to his story of how he had captured the Eskimo.
Dick and Sandy were principally interested in the
appearance of this native of the polar regions. They
found him to be about Sandy&rsquo;s height, with light
brown skin, and Chinese-like eyes. The hood of his
caribou shirt had been pushed back and a heavy
thatch of straight black hair was revealed. The
Eskimo&rsquo;s cheekbones were high like an Indian&rsquo;s and
his skin was very oily looking. Constable Sloan,
who had been detailed on the expedition principally
because of his special knowledge of the Eskimos in
their native haunts, was endeavoring to carry on
a conversation with the sullen fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t talk much,&rdquo; the Constable turned to
Corporal McCarthy. &ldquo;Says his name is Mukwa and
that four families of Eskimos are about a day&rsquo;s
march from here, on the shores of a bay somewhere
near Cape Richards. Swears he hasn&rsquo;t seen any
white men, and claims he&rsquo;s an outcast of his tribe.
I don&rsquo;t believe all he says. I believe he could speak
English if he wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to hold him anyway,&rdquo; declared
the Corporal. &ldquo;The fellow seems to be hostile, and
maybe he&rsquo;ll talk after a while. If everything&rsquo;s ship-shape
we&rsquo;ll mush on before it gets too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constable Sloan&rsquo;s thirty-foot dog whip cracked
out over the team and the dogs set off, yelping
eagerly. Corporal McCarthy took up the rear with
the Eskimo captive. There was little talking, since
every member of the expedition realized he must
save his wind for the gruelling miles that must be
covered before they made camp.</p>
<p>Though at that time of year there was no darkness
at night, Dick and Sandy felt that it was long
past evening before Corporal McCarthy called a
halt. There was not enough vegetation for a campfire
to be built, but the policemen were forearmed
with small oil stoves, for heat and cooking. It was
not long before the dogs were secured for the night,
and the boys were hovering in the doorway of their
tent over a bubbling pot of tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we ought to see an Eskimo village,&rdquo;
Dick said, trying to keep his teeth from chattering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a great experience,&rdquo; Sandy rejoined, &ldquo;but
the farther we go the more I wonder just why we
are up here. Uncle Walter tried to cover up everything
under that sham about him thinking we ought
to see the Eskimos, but they don&rsquo;t send the King&rsquo;s
men up here for sight seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick studied a moment, then replied: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
wanted to say anything until I was sure, but I believe
now that I have it figured out right. You know
Corporal Thalman was sent up here a year ago
to bring in a murderer. The fellow was reported
to be part Eskimo. Fred Mistak by name. I think
the two officers with us are looking for Corporal
Thalman and Mistak. They intend to leave us in
some winter camp with plenty of meat and fuel,
while they do the dangerous business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy sniffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see them keep me
out of the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that way too,&rdquo; agreed Dick, blowing on a
cup of hot tea, &ldquo;but we mustn&rsquo;t be stubborn about it.
It&rsquo;s best that we mind our own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constable Sloan had finished preparing the evening
meal of beans, pemmican and biscuit, and the
boys joined the rest of the party, conversation giving
way, for the time, to other exercises of the jaws.</p>
<p>Immediately after the meal was over everyone
retired in their sleeping bags, except Toma, who was
left to guard Mukwa, the Eskimo captive, for the
first part of the night. The wind had been steadily
rising and now was howling at terrific speed across
the frail tents, carrying a burden of fine snow along
with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Dick Kent dozed to the droning rattle of the icy
particles upon the tent walls. Sandy already was
fast asleep. It was frightfully cold, and Dick dared
not peep out of his sleeping bag without something
over his ears. Uncovered, they would have been
frozen in a few seconds. As he lay thinking over
the events of the day, he could hear faintly the voice
of Toma as he endeavored to quiet some whimpering
dogs. Finally those sounds, too, died away and
nothing remained except the whistle of the driving
gale, which soon lulled Dick to sleep.</p>
<p>It seemed to Dick he had been asleep only a
moment when he awakened suddenly, all senses alert,
an unmistakable scream of anguish echoing in his
ears. Holding his breath, he listened, but the sound
was not repeated. He tried to recollect if he had
been dreaming and was sure he had not. No, from
a sound slumber something had awakened him&mdash;something
whose peril he sensed subconsciously,
and which set his heart pounding faster. An instant
longer he listened, then, drawing his hood about
his head, he wriggled part way out of his sleeping
bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The wind was blowing almost as hard as before
he had gone to sleep, but now and again it died
down. During one of these lulls, Dick heard a
groan. With a start, he jumped up. He must find
out that it was not merely his imagination before he
awakened the others. They needed sleep. Cautiously,
he grasped his rifle and crawled to the opening
of the tent. He drew back the tent flap and
looked out. Toma&rsquo;s tent was the point that attracted
his attention first. Everything plainly visible under
the midnight sun, Dick could see that the tent&rsquo;s flap
was closed. Then, out of the corner of one eye
he detected a movement. A dark blotch appeared
on the snow in front of Toma&rsquo;s tent where the
Eskimo captive had been left, well tied with thongs.
The dark blotch moved again. With a cry of consternation,
Dick suddenly galvanized into action and
sprang forward. He found Toma lying in the
snow, a spear protruding from one of his thighs,
and a red stain in the snow under the young Indian&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; came Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s call,
as he awakened and hurried out upon hearing the
sound of Dick&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma has been wounded!&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Eskimo gone&mdash;the captive?&rdquo; McCarthy
answered his own question by snatching back the
flap of Toma&rsquo;s tupik. Yes, Mukwa was gone!</p>
<p>A little later, a cup of tea having completely revived
him, Toma told his anxious listeners what had
happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can hear nothing but wind,&rdquo; he said in his
quaint throaty dialect. &ldquo;I am sit in tent&mdash;Eskimo
back inside. I think about my home, my mother.
I dream. Think no harm come out of storm. Then
I jump to see face looking at me. That fella throw
spear. Hit me in leg. Somebody hit me on head
same time. All get black like night. Me think
Mukwa&rsquo;s friends come git him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A careful examination showed that the spear
wound in Toma&rsquo;s leg was slight, the bearskin
trousers having protected him, and aside from a
lump on his head, the hardy young aborigine would
soon be well again.</p>
<p>But there was no sleep after that. Dick and
Sandy sat up with Toma, drinking hot tea and
listening to the mutter of voices from the policemen&rsquo;s
tent. Evidently, action could not be long off,
since a council of war was underway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE FACE IN THE ICE WINDOW</span></h2>
<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock next morning when Constable
McCarthy ordered the tents struck, the sledges
packed and the dogs harnessed. The wind, during
the sunlit night, had covered up all the tracks made
by the men who had freed the Eskimo captive, and
little time was spent trying to trace them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Eskimos could have done anything in that
blizzard,&rdquo; Dick remarked to Sandy, while he tightened
sledge lashing.</p>
<p>Sandy did not reply, for at the moment Constable
McCarthy gave orders to mush on, and across
the icy drifts the dogs scampered northward.</p>
<p>All day the dog team labored on, stopped only now
and then to breathe. Dick and Sandy were thankful
for these short halts, for hardy as they were, the
slippery going was exhausting. Toma was not
troubled, however. The young Indian probably
could have out-traveled even the veteran northman,
Jim Sloan, who had once trekked the ice floes of
the frozen Polar Sea, six hundred miles from the
north pole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Toward evening the deep blue of the open sea
could be seen far ahead, marking the fiord or bay
that was their destination. Sloan did a lot of reconnoitering
from various high hills, but they had
reached the ragged coastline before the Eskimo
village was sighted.</p>
<p>Constable Sloan, who was to act as interpreter,
advised them to make a halt while he went forward
alone and talked with the heads of the families.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy watched the big policeman make
off toward the strange dwellings upon the shore of
the fiord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those snow houses must be igloos,&rdquo; said Dick,
pointing. &ldquo;How queer they are&mdash;just the shape of
bee-hives, with the little round holes at the bottom,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where the people are,&rdquo; Sandy spoke up,
&ldquo;and what is that queer smell that seems to come
from the igloos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick could not answer the question. Corporal
McCarthy laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll smell worse smells than
that before we get away from these Eskimos,&rdquo; said
the officer. &ldquo;But what you smell just now is probably
fresh walrus meat, or seal blubber. The natives
have been hunting all day, I suppose, and are almost
all asleep now inside their houses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>A moment after Constable Sloan had stopped before
one of the igloos, a figure crawled out of the
tiny entrance. There seemed no sign whatever of
hostility in the greetings exchanged by the policeman
and the native.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the spear-throwing
habit,&rdquo; observed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, as a rule the Eskimos are a peaceful people,&rdquo;
said Corporal McCarthy.</p>
<p>Constable Sloan, at this moment, turned and signalled
them to come on, and when they reached the
igloos, several other Eskimos had come out of their
houses to satisfy their native curiosity. There were
women and children among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the older men and women look almost
alike!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard there&rsquo;s little difference in the appearance
of Eskimo men and women,&rdquo; Dick replied,
&ldquo;but they say you can tell by the sizes of their hoods&mdash;the
women have extra big ones so they can carry
their babies in them during mild weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; Constable Sloan turned to Dick and
Sandy, &ldquo;I guess we can camp here for the night
anyway. Sipsa, the man I&rsquo;ve been talking to, gives
us a hearty welcome, especially after I told him we
had some shiny, new knives and hatchets in our
packs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;d like to do first is look around inside
one of those snow houses,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Do you
suppose Sandy and I might go into one?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can fix that alright,&rdquo; agreed Constable
Sloan, and turned to Sipsa. Followed a few words
in the Eskimo tongue. Sipsa seemed delighted at
the opportunity to show the boys the inside of his
strange home, and soon Dick and Sandy were on
their hands and knees, crawling through the door
of a most unusual residence.</p>
<p>They found the interior of the igloo to be much
larger than it appeared from an outside estimation,
due to the fact that it was cut down several feet into
a solid snowdrift. A small, soapstone lamp, shaped
like a clam shell, was burning, having a wick of
moss which absorbed the seal oil fuel. The boys
were surprised at the amount of heat the lamp
radiated. The furniture consisted of a long bench-like
lounge, covered with caribou and musk-ox hides.
Here and there lay harpoons, knives, whalebone
dishes and spoons, and crude implements, the use of
which the boys did not know. There were two
windows with panes made of opaque ice. The atmosphere
was heavy with the strong smell of fresh
blubber, and Dick and Sandy did not care to remain
inside very long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; snorted Dick, as he reached the open
air. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand to live in a smell like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; agreed Sandy, &ldquo;but just the same I
think one of those snow houses would be just the
thing for us to live in while in this cold country.
The camp stoves would make plenty of heat, and we
ought to be cozy as anything in an igloo that was
minus that awful stink.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless a skunk happened to slip into bed with
us,&rdquo; added Dick drolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to see the skunk that was fool enough to
migrate north of the Arctic Circle,&rdquo; laughed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t seen any that cared for icicles
on their whiskers,&rdquo; admitted Dick, still grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to change such a sweet smelling subject,&rdquo;
Sandy rejoined, &ldquo;but what do you say we
start building ourselves one of those igloos before
bedtime? I&rsquo;ll go ask Corporal McCarthy for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Corporal thought the idea a practical one,
and had Constable Sloan show them how it was
done.</p>
<p>At some distance from the Eskimo igloos, a huge,
solid snowdrift was located. A number of blocks
were cut out of this, leaving a hollow hole, perfectly
round. The blocks that had been removed
were then shaped and fitted with knives and built
up over the cavity in the drift, formulating part of
the walls and the roof. Spaces were left for a small
entrance and for two windows, whose panes were
formed by pouring melted snow water over the open
spaces. In the intensely cold temperature the water
froze as it dripped, the icicles finally joining to make
an opaque windowpane, crude but serviceable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>It was time to retire when Dick and Sandy finally
moved into the igloo, and, crawling into their warm
sleeping bags, prepared to pass their first night under
the roof of one of the finest residences known
to the people of the great polar ice cap.</p>
<p>But sleep was slow in coming to them in their
unusual surroundings, and presently they crawled
out again and, to put in the time, tried broiling musk-ox
and walrus steaks over the oil heater. The musk-ox
was quite tasty, if a bit strong from improper
handling, but they scarcely could stomach the bitter,
greasy walrus meat. Had the boys known what was
in store for them&mdash;that some day soon they would
think walrus almost as delicious as roast chicken,
they might not have looked upon their future adventures
in the polar region with such eagerness.
But, as the saying goes, &ldquo;What they did not know
did not hurt them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two policemen, together with Toma, whose
leg wound was troubling him only a little, came
in to inspect the finished igloo before they again
rolled into their sleeping bags and one and all pronounced
it an ideal abode for cold weather. Before
the visitors went out again, they vowed that the
next time they camped for any length of time they
should live Eskimo style.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Dick asked several pointed questions regarding
what the policemen intended doing now that they
had reached the northern coast, but both the Corporal
and the Constable were evasive. Dick was
not the sort of lad who became meddlesome or
troublesomely inquisitive, so he went no further.
When Sandy and he were again alone, they discussed
the approach of the polar winter, wondering how
they would weather it and admiring that heroic explorer
of the past who had gone so far as to reach
the north pole, making the name of Robert Peary
famous for all time.</p>
<p>A little later, when they had turned out their
stove, preparatory to crawling into their sleeping
bags, they became aware how difficult it was to sleep
with the yellow radiance of the sun still pervading
the inside of the igloo. The windows were not
clear enough for the light to be bright, but, nevertheless,
the absence of darkness made them so restless,
they decided to get up and go outside.</p>
<p>They found the sun hanging low over the horizon,
a pale ball of yellow, pouring its rays over the bleak
and desolate northland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange it seems!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Just think&mdash;at
Fort Good Faith it&rsquo;s nice and dark and maybe
the moon is up. I wonder what the folks at home
would say if they knew we were at this very minute
seeing the midnight sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hardly seems possible we&rsquo;re a thousand miles
farther north than we&rsquo;ve ever been,&rdquo; Sandy spoke
awedly.</p>
<p>But tired muscles and the intense cold soon made
their eyes heavy, and in spite of the sun they went
back to their sleeping bags.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Dick could not sleep, however. The sunlight, the
excessive amount of black tea he had drunk, and
the exhaustive efforts of the day combined to keep
him awake. He tossed in his warm bag wishing he
had the ability to sleep as soundly and quickly as
Sandy, whose snores he could plainly hear.</p>
<p>The oil stove had warmed the igloo quite thoroughly&mdash;enough
so that Dick felt slightly uncomfortable,
though it was more than forty below zero
outside. He wriggled restlessly and looked out of
his sleeping bag, gazing up at the white dome of the
igloo ceiling. He was about ready to turn over and
try harder to sleep, when he thought he heard something
brush against the igloo roof at a level with
the snow outside. At first he believed it was only a
prowling dog, and was determined to ignore it, when
there came plainly to his ears the crunch of a footfall
in the snow.</p>
<p>One of the ice windows was directly over the
spot where Sandy was sleeping, and toward this
Dick&rsquo;s attention was suddenly attracted as through
a sixth sense. A shadow had loomed up in the tiny
square&mdash;the shadow of a face peering in!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Dick sat up with a start and grasped his rifle.
Evidently, whoever was looking in could see nothing,
since it was darker inside the igloo than outside.
Taking advantage of the prowler&rsquo;s inability to
see, Dick picked up his rifle and pushed back the
huge cake of snow which plugged up the small round
door. Softly, then, he stole outside and commenced
the crawl around the igloo toward the window
through which he had seen the face. Yet he must
have made more noise than he thought, for at the
moment he reached a point from which he could see
the spying person, there sounded a guttural outcry,
and the crunch of running feet across the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Dick, leaping up and firing his
rifle into the air.</p>
<p>But the fleeing culprit had a good start and he
proved not slow on his feet. Dick watched the dark
form vanish in the dim sunlight, while the aroused
camp scrambled out to see what was wrong.</p>
<p>Corporal McCarthy listened intently to Dick&rsquo;s
story of what had happened. The officer said little at
the time, but presently he entered the boys&rsquo; igloo,
calling in the Constable and Toma.</p>
<p>When they all were comfortably seated, Corporal
McCarthy addressed the boys:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has just happened, on top of the capture
we made yesterday, makes me feel as if I ought to
explain the real motive of this long trip. Your
Uncle Walter McClaren wanted me to keep you
fellows out of trouble, provided there was no real
need of your services, but now that we seem to be
right in the territory of the fellow we are after, it
looks like I&rsquo;ll have to enlist you in the service of the
mounted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy exchanged glances and became all
ears, as the Corporal went on:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Thalman, an officer sent out ahead of
us, has been either killed or lost somewhere in this
region, while trailing a half-breed Eskimo murderer,
called Fred Mistak. Sloan and I are after Corporal
Thalman, or what&rsquo;s left of him, and of course we
intend to get Mistak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; Dick whispered aside to
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will probably be up here for several months,&rdquo;
continued the Corporal, &ldquo;and about all I&rsquo;ll expect of
you fellows is to keep your eyes open for a white
Eskimo. Just a hunch of mine, and while you&rsquo;re
doing that, Sloan and I will look around for traces
of Thalman. We&rsquo;ll all have to hunt, more or less, in
the meantime, because we haven&rsquo;t enough meat in
our supplies to last. Ought to be plenty of musk-ox
further inland. For the present we&rsquo;ll make this
Eskimo village our headquarters. I guess that&rsquo;s
about all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; said Dick, and Sandy nodded
importantly. Toma&rsquo;s inscrutable face did not express
the excitement he must have shared with his
two young white friends.</p>
<p>When the policemen departed a few moments
later, they left behind them two sleepless boys, who
could scarcely wait for the real beginning of the
man hunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">BIG GAME</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Polar bear tracks!&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s exclamation
brought Sandy to his side in an instant and together
they bent over a human-like footprint in the snow,
their rifles clutched tightly in mittened hands that
already had begun to perspire with the excitement
of promised big game.</p>
<p>It was three days since the boys had arrived at
the Eskimo camp with the policemen, and the present
found them hunting musk-oxen several miles from
camp. Corporal McCarthy and Constable Sloan
had gone to a neighboring Eskimo village, seeking
information regarding the lost Corporal Thalman,
and Toma had been left at headquarters to take care
of the dogs and keep a lookout for the &ldquo;white
Eskimo,&rdquo; whose presence in the vicinity had been
suspected due to the incident of the whalebone spear,
and to the spy who had looked in at the igloo window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The policemen had not exercised bad judgment in
leaving the boys alone. Dick Kent and Sandy
McClaren had proved to the mounted police how
capable they were of taking care of themselves in
the savage northland, and the self-control they
evidenced upon sighting the polar bear tracks was
ample proof that the dangers they already had coped
with had strengthened them for even more daring
deeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be very old,&rdquo; Sandy commented, in a
whisper, after inspecting the bear tracks a few
moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than an hour, I&rsquo;ll bet,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>Both boys looked up and scanned the surrounding
vicinity. They were on a long, ice-caked slope
strewn with boulders, which led down to shore ice.
In the distance was open sea water, appearing almost
black due to the dim sunlight. There was no
sign of life in evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to track him,&rdquo; Dick suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think these rifles are of big enough
caliber to kill a polar bear?&rdquo; Sandy asked, as they
began searching for more tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that .32 Special of yours and my 45.20
ought to do the trick easily enough. Remember, try
to hit him in the soft spot under his ears, or right
behind the shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bear tracks were hard to follow since at
times they led over hard ice, or boulders, but now
and again the huge animal had stepped in soft snow
or loose soil and left signs of his passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>For nearly a quarter of an hour they followed
the trail along the slope. It finally led them to shore
ice, which had been heaped up in huge mounds by
the ocean waves during some Arctic storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go slow here,&rdquo; cautioned Dick.
&ldquo;The bear may pop out from behind any of these
piles of ice. He&rsquo;s probably hunting seals or fish out
at the edge of the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had Dick spoken when there sounded a
faint dog-like bark, and a puppyish whine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that, Sandy!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick.
&ldquo;Those sounds were made by seals. There must be
a small herd of them near here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved on cautiously toward the open water,
rifles held in readiness for instant use.</p>
<p>A hundred yards from the water they heard the
loud bellow of a bull seal, a number of frightened
barks, a blood-curdling growl, and then the sound
of bodies striking the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the bear!&rdquo; whispered Dick hoarsely. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
attacked the seals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later an arresting scene met their eyes,
as they reached level ice and saw open water a few
yards away. A huge polar bear, his shaggy, grayish
fur dripping wet, was struggling out of the sea,
holding in his jaws a young seal which still was
faintly crying. Further out in the water a dozen
seals were swiftly swimming toward an ice floe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back! He hasn&rsquo;t seen us,&rdquo; Dick said quickly,
and the boys darted behind a large ice cake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Together they peered cautiously around the edge
of their barricade. The ferocious animal was out
of the water now, shaking the water from his fur
like a big dog. The young seal had ceased to
struggle, and lay very still at the bear&rsquo;s feet. In
comparison with the tiny animal the polar bear
seemed as large as a horse. Dick and Sandy quailed
a little and pressed more closely together.</p>
<p>When the bear bent his head to nose over his kill,
the boys quietly placed their rifles to their shoulders
and took aim. Then followed a tense moment while
they waited for a movement that would expose the
bear&rsquo;s most vulnerable points. At seventy-five yards
they could not miss.</p>
<p>Slowly the bear picked up the seal in his jaws and
paused an instant, seeming undecided as to what was
the most comfortable place in which to enjoy his
meal. Then two rifles cracked almost as one, and
the great beast dropped to his belly, the seal falling
from his jaws. Dick fired again swiftly, but Sandy
jerked ineffectually at the reloading lever of his rifle.
His gun had jammed in his haste.</p>
<p>A rattling growl came from the throat of the
stricken polar bear, and with an angry lunge, the
great brute started for the point from which the
bullets had come. Dick fired three more times in
quick succession, and a hundred feet from them the
bear at last dropped and began to struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got him!&rdquo; whooped Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Dick was about to echo his chum&rsquo;s triumphant
cry, when an ominous growl from behind them
froze the very blood in their veins with terror. As
one they whirled about. Down the slope to the
shore ice charged another polar bear, almost a
replica of the one they had just shot. The beast
was roaring its rage and was headed straight for the
two young hunters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run for your life!&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the bear&rsquo;s
mate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As fast as they could run Dick and Sandy set off
along the shore ice, exceeding all previous records.
They could hear the rattle of the bear&rsquo;s claws on the
ice as it came on in pursuit, and with each second
the angry growls sounded nearer.</p>
<p>Presently, Sandy began to fall behind in the race.
Frantically, Dick urged him on, slackening his own
pace to equal that of his slower chum, and while he
ran like a frightened deer, all Dick&rsquo;s narrow escapes
ran through his mind in swift succession, for he
believed that he and Sandy were doomed at last.</p>
<p>In a last desperate effort to save himself and
Sandy, Dick determined to make a stand with the
last two cartridges in his rifle. It was a plan born
of despair, he knew, for two shots at a running
target hardly could stop a beast of such massive
strength and vitality and in such a ferocious mood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It was then that the boys noticed a change in the
sounds of pursuit. The bear seemed to have fallen
behind, his growls gurgling strangely in his throat.</p>
<p>With renewed hope they ran on until a loud,
familiar shout pierced the icy air from a point behind
them. They looked back over their shoulders
and came to a staggering halt. A hundred yards
behind, the bear lay struggling his last, the shaft of
a harpoon protruding from its side, while above on
the slope stood an Eskimo beckoning to them.</p>
<p>The gratitude of Dick and Sandy could not be
expressed as they hurried toward the Eskimo who
had doubtless saved their lives.</p>
<p>Coming closer to the native, they recognized him
as Sipsa, who had proved so exceptionally friendly
at the village. He seemed to understand when the
boys tried to thank him, and conveyed by means of
many signs how he had been scouting for walrus
and seal when he had discovered the danger Dick
and Sandy had fallen into.</p>
<p>The boys followed Sipsa to the dead polar bear,
and watched him draw out the harpoon. So forcibly
had the weapon been driven that it had passed almost
entirely through the bear&rsquo;s thick body. Dick and
Sandy shivered as they examined the mighty jaws
and terrible claws that but for Sipsa&rsquo;s timely intervention
might have crushed and torn them to shreds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angekok, Angekok,&rdquo; Sipsa began repeating,
while pointing at the dead bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Sandy looked blankly at Dick, who was searching
his mind for the meaning of the word. At last he
recalled it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means &lsquo;devil.&rsquo; Angekok is the Eskimo word
for &lsquo;almighty devil.&rsquo; They believe in evil spirits, and
he&rsquo;s trying to tell us there was a devil in this bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s not far from right,&rdquo; Sandy declared
with genuine sincerity.</p>
<p>Presently the Eskimo managed to convey to the
boys that they must return to the village and get
sledges with which to haul in the meat of the two
bears.</p>
<p>Feeling they had had plenty of hunting for that
day, the boys were glad to consent to this, and all
three started back toward camp, led by Sipsa, who
had gained the great respect of Dick and Sandy.</p>
<p>Tired, hungry and cold, the chums at last reached
the Eskimo village, only to find all in a state of confusion
and uproar. Toma met them with an explanation
of the excitement tumbling from his ordinarily
reticent lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody steal um dog team an&rsquo; sledge,&rdquo; said
Toma. &ldquo;I in igloo, get um meat cooked for supper.
All Eskimo down by big water, ketch um seal.
When I come out I see not so many dogs, an&rsquo; one
sledge not there. I hurry up, tell um Eskimos.
They take dog team an&rsquo; go after this fella who steal
dog team.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t see the thief at all?&rdquo; asked Dick,
gravely concerned.</p>
<p>Toma shook his head vigorously. &ldquo;Him come an&rsquo;
go like bad spirit. No hear, no see. I no like that
kind thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was puzzled at first, then spoke: &ldquo;Sandy,
I have an idea this is more of the white Eskimo&rsquo;s
work. He could have got away pretty quietly if he
was a good hand with dogs, as I suppose he is.
I&rsquo;m certain now that Fred Mistak and the &lsquo;white
Eskimo&rsquo; are the same person. We&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, let&rsquo;s eat,&rdquo; said Sandy.</p>
<p>Dick discovered that he had as keen an appetite
as Sandy when in their cozy igloo he found a tasty
meal prepared by Toma. Both boys were too tired
to join the Eskimos, who in spite of the theft of the
dog team, set out to skin and cut up the polar bears,
leaving the camp deserted except for the three boys.
Dick and Sandy were later to learn that not even
a funeral could stand between an Eskimo and his
hunting. When there was meat to be had the natives
dropped everything until the last bit of it was safely
stored away. For wild meat was their only staple
diet&mdash;all that kept them from starving to death, and
during the real winter they could hunt but little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The boys had finished their supper and were relating
to Toma, in detail, their narrow escape from
the mad polar bear, when the barking dogs and the
sound of familiar voices interrupted them. They
tumbled out of the igloo to find Corporal McCarthy
and Constable Sloan. The policemen had just returned
from a long, fruitless trek eastward, and the
Corporal had frosted his feet.</p>
<p>What the boys had to say about the stolen dog
team was of especial interest to the officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without a doubt Fred Mistak is hiding near
here,&rdquo; commented Corporal McCarthy, when comfortably
seated in the boys&rsquo; igloo, with his bare feet
in a pan of snow to draw out the frost. &ldquo;So far,
I&rsquo;ll have to admit we&rsquo;ve done little better than nothing,
but we&rsquo;ll hope for better luck tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Corporal McCarthy did not finish his sentence.</p>
<p>A hoarse cry at the entrance of the igloo was the
interruption, and into their midst tumbled an Eskimo,
gibbering in a frightful manner, and groveling
on the floor as if he had lost his mind.</p>
<p>In the jumble of native words was audible the
frequent ejaculation: &ldquo;Angekok! Angekok!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him one them three go after fella what steal
dog team!&rdquo; Toma suddenly exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Corporal McCarthy. &ldquo;Sloan,&rdquo; he
wheeled toward the Constable, &ldquo;go out and see if
the other two have returned alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constable Sloan was out and back in a few moments.
&ldquo;Not a sign of anyone around&mdash;no dog
team either,&rdquo; the Constable reported quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>McCarthy&rsquo;s face took on a grave expression, and
his jaws hardened. &ldquo;Ask the Eskimo what scared
him?&rdquo; he directed Constable Sloan.</p>
<p>By this time the Eskimo had somewhat recovered
his natural calm, yet he frequently looked fearfully
toward the igloo entrance, as if he feared something
was coming in to get him.</p>
<p>The Constable&rsquo;s questions were brief and the Eskimo&rsquo;s
answers prompt, though his voice trembled
from fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Eskimo says it was the &lsquo;white Eskimo&rsquo; that
attacked them,&rdquo; Constable Sloan reported presently.
&ldquo;He says his two companions were killed and the
dogs taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deep silence fell upon all who had heard Constable
Sloan&rsquo;s words. It was several seconds before
Corporal McCarthy spoke rapidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready for the trail. We leave here just as
soon as we get a few hours&rsquo; sleep. I&rsquo;m going to
enlist Sipsa as a guide, and I&rsquo;ll get my man if I
have to trail him clear to the North Pole!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE WHITE ESKIMO</span></h2>
<p>It was thirty below zero the following morning
when two teams of twelve dogs, each drawing
sledges, loaded with supplies, departed from the little
village of igloos. The warm breath from man and
dog turned to vapor in the freezing air, and all were
enveloped in a cloud of steam as they trekked eastward
along the coastline.</p>
<p>Corporal McCarthy had found Sipsa willing to
lead the party and had also enlisted the aid of two
Eskimo dog drivers, Okewah and Ootanega. The
policeman had promised all of them large rewards
in tools, rifles, and tents, provided they served him
faithfully in pursuit of the &ldquo;white Eskimo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how soon we&rsquo;ll pick up the trail,&rdquo;
Sandy spoke from the depths of his frost-rimmed
parka.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;No telling,&rdquo; replied Dick through a cloud of
steam, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re now following the tracks made by the
Eskimo who came in last half scared to death. Corporal
McCarthy believes these tracks will lead to the
place where the white Eskimo and his men attacked
those three Eskimos who went after the stolen dog
team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys said no more then for the fast pace at
which they were traveling took all their breath. For
two hours they drove eastward across the snowfields
under a gray cloud filmed sky. At the end of this
time they came to a narrow defile between huge
blocks of ice that had been thrown up by the waves
at high tide. They threaded their way among the
ice cakes for about a hundred yards when they
came upon the scene of a terrible tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the two Eskimos that failed to come back
last night!&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s horrified exclamation was echoed
by Sandy while the two policemen and the Eskimos
bent over the two huddled forms in the snow.</p>
<p>The Eskimos had been killed, and all about them
were signs of a deadly struggle. One sledge had
been crushed, and its packing torn up and rifled of
supplies. Two dogs lay dead, and prowling foxes
had torn them to bits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t the work of Fred Mistak, then I
don&rsquo;t know my name!&rdquo; Corporal McCarthy cried,
shaking his fist at the white silent hills. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll
get him, we&rsquo;ll get him, and he&rsquo;ll pay a big price!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy thrilled at the words, and
hastened to lend a hand to the burial of the bodies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Two typical Eskimo graves were made by heaping
small boulders upon the dead natives in a cairn-like
mound, which would keep away the foxes, which
had as yet scarcely harmed them, probably because
the dogs had satisfied them for the present. To
agree with the superstitions of the Eskimos the
sledges, weapons and other paraphernalia of the deceased
were buried with the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that sorry business is over,&rdquo; Corporal McCarthy
addressed the somber company, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll pick
up Mistak&rsquo;s trail and see how fast we can mush.
Every man of you keep watch for an ambush. This
fellow is about as desperate as they make them, and
we&rsquo;ve already had a taste of his treachery. It&rsquo;s our
hide or his and let&rsquo;s be careful it&rsquo;s his. Mush on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the dogs buckled into the harness and
the long Eskimo whips lashed and crackled over
many bobbing, white tails.</p>
<p>But it was a weary, half-frozen company that
camped late that night without sighting the mysterious
person they pursued. Dick and Sandy were
almost too tired to be hungry once they had thrown
up their tupik, or Eskimo tent made of sealskins.
Not until they had drunk several cups of hot tea, an
indispensable drink in the far north, did they feel
anywhere near themselves, and could discuss the
doings of the day while munching hard biscuit and
pemmican.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where this trail will end?&rdquo; Sandy ventured
dubiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I knew,&rdquo; rejoined Dick, &ldquo;but I think the
&lsquo;white Eskimo&rsquo; will lead us on a real old wild goose
chase. He knows more about this country than any
of us, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he knew the lay
of the land better than any of these Eskimo guides.
Anyway the Eskimos can&rsquo;t be of much use in tracking
that fellow because they believe the &lsquo;white Eskimo&rsquo;
is an Angekok, or devil. They&rsquo;re so superstitious
that if we once got very close to the fellow
we&rsquo;re chasing, they&rsquo;d probably lead us astray or run
off and leave us alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they believe in ghosts alright,&rdquo; agreed
Sandy, pouring another cup of tea.</p>
<p>Dick was about to continue the discussion, when
he chanced to look through the opening of their
tupik.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; he grasped Sandy&rsquo;s arm tensely.</p>
<p>What Dick saw was their three Eskimo hands
gathered before their tupik in a private council of
some secret purpose. The native drivers were gesturing
excitedly with their hands and heads, evidently
arguing with Sipsa, the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drivers seem to be ready to quit right now,
the way they act,&rdquo; observed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t go far without them, at least,
without a guide. I ought to tell Corporal McCarthy
about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, no more were the words out of Dick&rsquo;s
mouth than the police Corporal approached the three
Eskimos and scattered them to various tasks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Presently the Corporal joined the boys in their
tent and confirmed their fears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid these
Eskimos will desert us if we don&rsquo;t keep close watch
of them,&rdquo; said the policeman. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all have to
take turns on watch tonight, tired as we are. I
think Sipsa still is loyal, but the other two are doing
their best to make him desert. The &lsquo;white Eskimo&rsquo;
certainly has them scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was twelve o&rsquo;clock when Dick Kent&rsquo;s turn came
to stand watch, and it was with some difficulty that
he shook the sleep out of his eyes when Constable
Sloan spoke to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll have any trouble tonight after
all,&rdquo; the Constable reassured him. &ldquo;The Eskimos
seem pretty quiet, but be ready for anything and
don&rsquo;t hesitate to call McCarthy and me if anything
unusual turns up. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick shivered as he took his post at the entrance
of the tupik with rifle in his mittened hands. The
dogs were quarreling among themselves where they
were leashed to the sledges, and from the Eskimos&rsquo;
tupik came the muffled sound of voices. They did
not seem as quiet now as Constable Sloan had reported
them. They were speaking in their native
tongue and Dick could not understand what they
were talking about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just keep close watch of their tent,&rdquo; he murmured
to himself. &ldquo;If any of them try to sneak
away I&rsquo;ll call the policemen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>An hour passed, the Eskimos quieting down and
apparently falling asleep. The vast silence of the
far north brooded over the little encampment, when
Dick detected, out of the corner of his eye, a movement
beyond the huddled dogs. It was like a small
animal that had moved across the top of a snowdrift.
Dick&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat as he strained
his eyes to catch sight of whatever had appeared.</p>
<p>A dog growled, and Dick spoke quietly to the big
huskies, getting up and going to them. The leader
of the team, a giant malemute, was sitting up, his
ears alert, and his nose wriggling as he sniffed the
air uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, old boy?&rdquo; whispered Dick. &ldquo;What
do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The malemute growled ominously in answer, his
hair rising along his back as he scented some sort
of danger.</p>
<p>Dick looked carefully about camp again, seeking
the cause for the dog&rsquo;s uneasiness, but all seemed
peaceful enough. Impulsively, he decided to walk
out to the drift where he had seen the suspicious
movement, thinking he would find there the tracks
of some animal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The drift was only about fifty yards from the
sledges where the dogs were tied, and Dick soon
reached it. About to go around the drift and investigate,
a weird, low call from behind him brought
him to an abrupt halt, the blood congealing in his
veins at the strangeness of the sound. He turned
and looked back at camp. There came a soft swishing
sound from the snowdrift he had been about
to inspect, and he whirled to see a dark form bearing
down upon him. His startled cry was cut off
sharply as something hard descended forcefully upon
his head and he went down in the snow, thousands
of stars blazing before his eyes.</p>
<p>But Dick had not been knocked entirely unconscious.
He lay still a moment until his senses came
back to him, feeling the person who had attacked
him leap over him and toward camp. Then came the
cries of the aroused camp, mingled with the barking
dogs, and above all the shriek of a frightened Eskimo,
followed by a wail of fear.</p>
<p>Struggling to his feet, Dick saw Corporal McCarthy
taking aim at two fleeing figures, and heard
his rifle crack. But the policeman was firing into
the air, merely to frighten the attackers.</p>
<p>Sipsa was struggling in the strong arms of Constable
Sloan, and from the mouthings of the frightened
native Dick could make out that Sipsa had
seen the &ldquo;white Eskimo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the drivers?&rdquo; Dick shouted to Sandy
who was standing as if stunned, his rifle held in his
hands.</p>
<p>Sandy seemed to regain his wits at that and dived
for the Eskimos&rsquo; tupik along with Dick. They almost
collided with Toma coming out of the tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Um gone,&rdquo; said Toma, &ldquo;Um run away when
seen um &lsquo;white Eskimo.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth of Toma&rsquo;s statement was soon revealed
when a search of the camp and the vicinity revealed
no sign of the two drivers, other than their tracks
in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Corporal McCarthy, &ldquo;I guess the
&lsquo;white Eskimo&rsquo; knows how to scare the wits out of
the natives. I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s any use for
us to chase our guides. They&rsquo;d be of no further
use anyway. I hope Sipsa doesn&rsquo;t take it into his
head to follow them when he gets a chance to break
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky to have whole skins,&rdquo; Constable
Sloan remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head feels as if it was too big for my parka,&rdquo;
said Dick, manfully fighting off a dizzy spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry into your tent and I&rsquo;ll get the medicine
kit,&rdquo; said Corporal McCarthy. &ldquo;I want to get going
again in an hour anyway. We ought to locate some
more drivers tomorrow, and if possible, overtake
Mistak, the &lsquo;white Eskimo,&rsquo; before he gets another
lead on us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s head wound proved not serious. His heavy
parka had protected his scalp from the blow, which
had probably been made with a spear butt. There
was, however, a large lump about the size of an egg
over his left temple, and it was rather sore. But the
young northman would not think of delaying the
pursuit, and speedily forgot his slight wound as he
hustled about making tea, while Sandy and Toma
lent willing hands with the packs and dog harnesses.</p>
<p>Within an hour dog and man had partaken of an
early breakfast and were mushing grimly along a
fresh trail under the midnight sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a wise move on our part,&rdquo; Dick told
Sandy as they woddled along on their snowshoes.
&ldquo;Mistak won&rsquo;t expect us to start out so soon and
we&rsquo;ve a good chance to overtake him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get the creeps whenever I think of that Eskimo
stealing into camp that way,&rdquo; rejoined Sandy. &ldquo;Suppose
he is a kind of a devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;just because these
poor, superstitious Eskimos are frightened is no
sign you should be. I&rsquo;ll admit he&rsquo;s a dangerous
character, but he&rsquo;s no more than a human being, and
the mounted will get him in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was about to reply when an exclamation
from one of the policemen silenced him.</p>
<p>They had come out on the rim of an ice-bound
ridge and below them stretched a vast valley bounded
by the sea on the north and filled with age-old ice
formations.</p>
<p>Directly below them were two dog teams, the
drivers of which had apparently not yet detected
the mounted police.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Dick and Sandy could not forbear a cheer as
Corporal McCarthy called for full speed ahead and
they drove the dogs yelping down the slope toward
the fugitives from justice. At that moment it looked
very much as if Fred Mistak&rsquo;s career of outlawry
were doomed already, and the boys prepared themselves
for a battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">AT SEA IN KAYACKS</span></h2>
<p>When Dick and Sandy sighted the dog team of
what they believed to be the &ldquo;white Eskimo,&rdquo; it could
not have been more than a half a mile away, though
distances in the north are deceptive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to catch up with them in twenty
minutes,&rdquo; Constable Sloan had said.</p>
<p>But they were not so fortunate. Either the &ldquo;white
Eskimo&rdquo; had seen his pursuers and was therefore
driving faster, or his dogs were faster at a normal
pace of travel than the police dogs. At any rate,
after thirty minutes, fast driving they were bumping
along over a rough ice floor, the team ahead nowhere
in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be far to the sea shore now, can it?&rdquo;
panted Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dick replied, &ldquo;we are probably traveling
across a frozen bay now. The ice may be hundreds
of feet thick here, you know, and the sun never
gets warm enough to melt that much ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes awfully cold weather to freeze salt
water,&rdquo; Sandy opined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it does!&rdquo; agreed Dick emphatically,
&ldquo;but you know most of the ice around here is from
old glaciers, and is fresh water ice. The glaciers
slide down to the sea shore and break off, making
ice-bergs and huge ice floes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Look out!&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s cry of warning came
too late. Dick had been so interested in his explanation
of the ice formations that he had not noticed
how close he was to a treacherous slope of glassy
ice. He slipped, and before he could catch himself
he had whizzed down, flat on his back, to come up
with a bump in a hard snowdrift at the bottom of
the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; called Sandy anxiously, as Dick
crawled out of the snow, sat up and began shaking
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ve got my parka full of snow,&rdquo; Dick
called back, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not a very pleasant feeling
with melted snow trickling down your chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policemen had stopped upon seeing Dick&rsquo;s
accident, and they now waited until he had climbed
back up the slippery slope before they went on.</p>
<p>Dick was not much the worse for the spill in the
snow, since the heat of his body under the warm
clothing soon dried up the snow that had seeped in.
He forgot the accident in anticipation of the excitement
ahead, for at any moment all hands expected
to sight the dog team of Fred Mistak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>A breeze had sprung up, blowing in their faces,
and they all could feel the nearness of the sea by the
dampness in the air. Then, suddenly, they rounded a
huge heap of snow-covered ice to come upon a vast
bay of open water and a most discouraging sight. A
mile out to sea, in native boats, they could see their
quarry vanishing toward a snow-capped, rocky
island.</p>
<p>Even as they watched they saw one tiny figure
raise up and wave a defiant hand at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s flown the coop this time,&rdquo; said Corporal
McCarthy through his teeth, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re not
beaten yet&mdash;not by a long shot. Sloan, bring Sipsa
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy followed the Constable and the
Eskimo guide to Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Sipsa we must get Eskimo boats immediately,&rdquo;
was the policeman&rsquo;s command. &ldquo;Enough
boats to carry all of us along with our provisions,
dogs, and sledges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Sloan had explained this to Sipsa, the Eskimo
shook his head at first, but finally seemed to
offer some encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s not sure he can find any Eskimos
very near here,&rdquo; Sloan turned to Corporal McCarthy.
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll try. He says we&rsquo;ll have to take
a chance following the coast line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, then, we&rsquo;ll take the chance. We&rsquo;ve got
to have boats.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>But luck was with them, for they had not gone on
a mile when they came upon a dozen igloos in a
sheltered nook. The tribesmen were at sea, hunting
seals, and the women were scattered along the shore
skinning and cutting up the meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in luck in some ways,&rdquo; called Constable
Sloan, cheerfully, as they drew up at the igloos.
&ldquo;Now if we can only trade these fellows out of a
few native boats, we&rsquo;ll be luckier still. Here comes
a couple of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Eskimos approaching from the beach,
were evidently not at all afraid of the white men,
for they came up smiling, perfectly unconscious
that they put forth a bad appearance with their
clothing covered with seal blubber, grease and blood.</p>
<p>Sipsa immediately began talking with them, Sloan
permitting him to do the dickering for the boats.</p>
<p>When the policemen had opened one of the packs
and revealed some fine, shiney knives, kettles, and
axes, the Eskimos became greatly interested, and
one of them ran off to call the rest of the tribe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Presently they were all down at the sea shore
looking over the native boats, or kayacks. Corporal
McCarthy picked out one serviceable looking kayack,
and two umiacks, or large boats, for the dogs and
supplies. The kayack was about twenty feet long
and twenty inches wide, covered with water proofed
skins, and made to seat one person in a hole in the
center, over which was a flap that could be buttoned
around the chin, making the boat almost water tight,
even though it were capsized. The umiacks were,
however, flat-bottomed, hollow, and were ordinarily
used in transporting women, children, and household
goods by water. Corporal McCarthy gave the Eskimo
owners a large collection of knives, pots and
hatchets for the boats and they seemed very well
pleased with the trade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the kayack,&rdquo; instructed Corporal McCarthy.
&ldquo;Sloan, you and the Indian lad take one of
the umiacks and Dick, Sandy, and Sipsa the other.
If we get a move on we can get our equipment loaded
before Mistak gets too much of a start. He took
his dogs so we&rsquo;ll have to take ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not more than a half hour later Dick and Sandy
and the Eskimo guide put to sea in their umiack, a
crude sail of caribou hide stiffening in the breeze,
while they plied a paddle to add to their speed. Constable
Sloan and Toma followed immediately in the
other umiack, while the Corporal settled himself in
the kayack, the last of the three.</p>
<p>Corporal McCarthy soon passed the heavily loaded
umiacks in his faster and lighter boat and signaled
them to follow him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out for the ice bergs and floes,&rdquo; called
the corporal. &ldquo;If you see a walrus, don&rsquo;t shoot unless
you&rsquo;re attacked.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The three boats strung out in a line headed toward
the glacial island where they believed Mistak
would land. In Dick and Sandy&rsquo;s boat were half
the dogs and the two sledges, along with the stoves
and liquid fuel. It was a heavy load for the unwieldy
umiack, and Dick was not long in discovering
that the dangers in arctic navigation were not to be
scoffed at. Though from a distance the water
seemed free from ice, close at hand the bergs could
be seen rolling along, either submerged, or just above
the water. Sipsa took a position in the prow of the
umiack, where, with a long pole, he fended off the
larger ice blocks. In the stern Dick plied a paddle,
while in the center Sandy took care of the dogs and
saw that the cargo did not slip to one side and capsize
the craft.</p>
<p>All went well until they reached rougher water a
quarter mile from the shore. Here an ocean current
carried them eastward in spite of all they could do.
Sandy fashioned himself a paddle from a snow shoe
covered with a piece of seal skin, and did all he could
to help Dick in the uneven struggle, but they moved
steadily eastward toward a low headland that marked
that boundary of the bay. The island that was their
destination now lay several miles northwest of them,
and a floe separated the two umiacks. Corporal
McCarthy was having all he could do to manage his
kayack, which was being considerably buffeted about
by the waves and ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll strike another current when we get
close to that headland east of us,&rdquo; called Dick from
the stern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied Sandy dubiously. &ldquo;This sail
isn&rsquo;t doing us much good now though. The wind
seems to have gone down suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Sipsa, the Eskimo guide, rammed
his pole at a submerged ice berg, and the pole slipped
down into the water, forcing Sipsa to lose his balance.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s cry of warning did no good. The Eskimo
did the best he could to keep his balance, then toppled
head foremost into the chilly water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, help him in, Sandy!&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;while
I hold the boat as steady as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy dropped his paddle and hurried to the
prow where Sipsa was struggling about in the water.
The Eskimo still retained a tight grip on his pole,
which had been the cause of his fall, and Sandy got
a grip on this. Soon Sipsa crawled, gasping and
gurgling, into the umiack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew, close shave that!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe he&rsquo;ll freeze to death from that wetting,&rdquo;
Dick added. &ldquo;Sandy, you&rsquo;d better get one of
the heaters started so he can dry off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sipsa, hardy Eskimo that he was, made it
known, by various signs, that he needed no heater,
and took up his former position as if nothing had
happened. While the ducking might have been fatal
for Dick or Sandy, it meant little to the guide
since the season was what he called summer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Once off the headland the current swept them
northward as they had hoped, and also a breeze
sprang up from the open sea. The sail filled and they
began to make time toward the island. The floe
which had separated the umiacks had passed on and
Dick and Sandy could see Toma and Constable Sloan
coming along safely a quarter mile behind. Corporal
McCarthy was within speaking distance again and
his voice boomed out over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out for walrus! There&rsquo;s a big bull in here
somewhere. Steer clear of him if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment was a tense one for Dick and Sandy.
Many a story they had heard of these giant inhabitants
of the Polar Sea, and to meet one in his native
haunts was something they feared, yet hoped to
experience.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon the water near at
hand when something dark welled up out of the
clear blue depths and shot past the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it was a walrus?&rdquo; Sandy hazarded breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been. It had big flippers and I
think I saw tusks like an elephant&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was your imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>But what happened next assured Sandy that Dick
had not been using his imagination. A dark form
heaved up out of the water almost under Sipsa&rsquo;s ice
pole. The umiack rocked dangerously and nearly
upset the Eskimo. The boys got a clear look at the
walrus this time for just a moment as the huge creature
reared out of the water and looked at them
before it sunk out of sight in a whirlpool of bubbles.</p>
<p>Sandy snatched up his rifle, but Dick warned him
to hold fire until it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the walrus?&rdquo; called Corporal McCarthy
backing water with his paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet it was,&rdquo; Dick shouted, &ldquo;and if he&rsquo;d been
two feet nearer he&rsquo;d have turned us over&mdash;hey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick said no more for at that instant the umiack,
with its heavy load, was hoisted upward out of the
water from the impact of a powerful body underneath.
Sipsa tumbled backward from the prow, falling
in among the whimpering dogs. Sandy and
Dick clung to their seats while the boat dropped back
to the water with a heave and splash. Fortunately,
the umiack settled to an even keel without taking
in too much water. But scarcely had they recovered
from the nearly disastrous effects of the walrus&rsquo;s
first attack, when Sipsa shouted a warning from the
stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is again&mdash;coming at us from the
front!&rdquo; shouted Sandy, throwing up his rifle as
Dick snatched up his own.</p>
<p>As Dick took aim at the rushing mass of fur,
tusks, and flippers, he saw Corporal McCarthy level
his rifle from the kayack. The three rifles boomed
almost as one. The walrus, hit hard, swerved and
rolled in his mad attack, and in a whirl of water
sank out of sight, leaving a red blot in the water
behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been wounded badly, if not killed,&rdquo; said
Sandy pointing at the blood in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll leave us alone anyway, but if he
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Dick tightened his grip on his rifle.</p>
<p>For several minutes they watched, guns ready,
for a renewal of the bull walrus&rsquo;s attack, but the
water disclosed no angry monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s had enough,&rdquo; called Corporal McCarthy,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s get going. Do you see what&rsquo;s coming
up from the east?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy looked as the policeman directed,
and their hearts jumped as if a hundred walruses
were bearing down upon them, for, not a mile distant,
a dense Arctic fog was floating swiftly toward
them, like a wall of gray smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fog!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Get that paddle, Sandy!
If we ever get caught in that fog we&rsquo;ll be lost sure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">LOST IN AN ARCTIC FOG</span></h2>
<p>After they had first sighted the fog it did not
seem more than five minutes before they were enveloped
in it. They could not see ten feet ahead of
them, and the only way they had of knowing they
were near one another was by shouting. The wind
lulled almost immediately and the umiack began to
drift straight north. In a few moments all hands
were wet to the skin. All around them the icebergs
and floes ground together with growling, grating
noises, like so many fierce animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, there!&rdquo; came the muffled bellow of Corporal
McCarthy through the heavy mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; shouted Dick at the top of his lungs, the
fog seeming to throw the sound of his voice back
into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep paddling to the right&mdash;against the current,&rdquo;
came the Corporal&rsquo;s command. &ldquo;Sing out
every few minutes so we can keep track of each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; shouted Dick, and behind came the
fainter sound of Constable Sloan&rsquo;s voice from the
other umiack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Progress now became dangerous indeed. The
boats seemed to have floated into a patch of broken
ice that threatened every minute to crush the frail
umiacks like so much match wood. Then, too, Corporal
McCarthy&rsquo;s shouts were growing fainter at
every repetition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re losing ground,&rdquo; called Dick to Sandy.
&ldquo;Work harder. Keep moving to the right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to do,&rdquo; called back Sandy
from the center of the boat, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a big floe
pushing us to the left. We can&rsquo;t seem to get around
it. Sipsa is doing all he can to keep us from getting
smashed up from the left. Look out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s warning shout was accompanied by a
violent jar that shook the umiack from bow to
stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve hit solid ice on the left!&rdquo; cried Sandy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be smashed between two floes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick leaped up and, leaning over the side of the
umiack, pushed on the ice that was threatening to
crush them against the floating ice on their right.</p>
<p>But his efforts were of no avail. The umiack
shuddered as if about to collapse under the pressure,
then seemed to rise out of the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ice has shoved under us!&rdquo; cried Dick, much
relieved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Dick was right. Luckily, the flat bottomed umiack
had grounded on the flat ice pushing against her
starboard side, and the higher ice on the lee was
pushing her farther over. Presently they were almost
entirely out of the water, the umiack half on
the ice floe and floating along with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay on this ice,&rdquo; called Sandy. &ldquo;It
will carry us out to sea and we&rsquo;ll be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick thought rapidly. It was a moment for quick
decision and daring action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy,&rdquo; he cried, his mind made up, &ldquo;stick by
the boat. I&rsquo;m going out on this floe and shove us
off as soon as we get to open water on one side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be drowned!&rdquo; wailed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to take a chance,&rdquo; was Dick&rsquo;s exclamation
as he leaped over the gunwale of the umiack to the
slippery surface of the fragment of floe upon which
they had been lifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me as soon as you see open water on the
left,&rdquo; shouted Dick to Sandy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way
we can get off this floe. I can&rsquo;t move the umiack
to the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright&mdash;wait,&rdquo; Sandy replied tensely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>There followed many moments of suspense when
each heart beat seemed painful. Little that Dick
knew of the northern seas, it was enough to make
the truth clear to him. If the floe they had grounded
upon joined with the ice on the left, and the entire
mass continued to move, they would be carried out
to sea and lost on an ocean where few ships had ever
navigated. It had been several minutes since they
had heard the voice of Corporal McCarthy, and
Constable Sloan&rsquo;s shouts were barely audible behind
and far to the east. Proof enough that the ice was
carrying them out beyond the headland that marked
the end of the bay. Tensely Dick waited, digging
his boots into little chinks of ice, ready to push off
at a word from Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s low exclamation steeled
Dick&rsquo;s muscles. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re breaking loose from the
other ice. The crack is getting wider. Wait a minute!
Alright, let her go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick drew a deep breath and bent all his strength
upon the heavy umiack. There came a slight grating
sound, a lurch and the umiack, with its heavy load,
slid from the floe into the sea, as Dick leaped into
the stern with a cry of relief.</p>
<p>But his relief was short lived, for when he lifted
his voice to shout to the other boats, there was no
reply. Again and again he shouted, until his voice
was hoarse, listening intently in the intervals. Not
even Sloan&rsquo;s voice was audible now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be way out of the course,&rdquo; Sandy said,
discouraged.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s spirits fell also, then when he was about to
give up shouting, he caught the sound of a voice
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;that&rsquo;s Constable Sloan,&rdquo; Dick said
tensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s funny&mdash;he seems to be on the left of
us,&rdquo; Sandy came back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>They listened again, often shouting together. This
time they were amazed to hear the faint call from
slightly to the right and ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Corporal McCarthy,&rdquo; Dick hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think it sounded like Constable Sloan,&rdquo;
Sandy disagreed. &ldquo;But how could he get over on
the right so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fog, I guess,&rdquo; Dick returned. &ldquo;The
sounds are deceiving. Anyway, we&rsquo;re certain this
floe on our right is between us and the island. We&rsquo;ll
have to keep on working ahead until we can get
around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I think, Dick?&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s voice
was exceedingly sober.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think? I&rsquo;m at my wit&rsquo;s end
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This floe has caught on a larger block of ice
somewhere on the other side and it has been turning
slowly. Dick, we don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;re at now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Dick hastily rejoined,
renewing his efforts at the paddle.</p>
<p>The boys now proceeded to bury their misgivings
in hard work on the paddles. Sipsa continued his
work at the prow of the craft, his expert handling
of the pole avoiding many a dangerous ice jam.
Yet as the minutes passed and they failed again and
again to raise even a faint shout from the balance
of the company, they became certain that they were
floating out to sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if this fog would only lift!&rdquo; Dick prayed.</p>
<p>They worked on for what seemed to them an hour
longer, but which actually could not have been more
than fifteen minutes, when it seemed that Dick&rsquo;s
prayer was about to be answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting lighter, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Sandy said hoarsely,
almost afraid to believe his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dick answered, cheering
up.</p>
<p>Slowly the fog thinned until they could see almost
a hundred feet around them, then, as swiftly as it
had enveloped them, the fog bank passed over, leaving
them half blinded by the sudden glare of sunlight.
Dick and Sandy cried out with joy, and rose
up in the umiack to look about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; Dick ejaculated as he feasted
his eyes on a welcome scene.</p>
<p>Sandy had been right. The floe which they had
been following had touched upon some solider object.
It had been the island!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>There was but a few yards of open water between
them and the barren, snow-piled shore, and the floe
on their right made a strong bridge to land. Half
a mile out to sea was the umiack of Constable Sloan
and Toma, making good time toward land. Corporal
McCarthy was waving his paddle to them a quarter
mile to the left, and, now that the fog no longer
deadened sound, his shout was borne to the ears
of the happy boys.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy immediately bent to the paddles
and worked the umiack into the beach, where they
pulled it upon dry land and commenced unloading it.</p>
<p>A half hour later the company was reunited, and
Corporal McCarthy gave orders to make camp, and
to stow the native boats high and dry on the shore
for future use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take a rest after that hard pull
across the bay,&rdquo; the policeman explained. &ldquo;But while
you fellows fix something to eat, I&rsquo;ll take a run along
the shore and see if I can&rsquo;t find where Mistak landed.
I&rsquo;d like to know more about this island we&rsquo;ve landed
on, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Corporal McCarthy was gone, Dick, Sandy
and Toma set to work with alacrity to help Constable
Sloan make camp. They were so hungry that their
mouths watered when they fed the ravenous dogs
their allotment of frozen fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could eat whalebone and like it,&rdquo; Dick said to
Sandy as he watched Constable Sloan pouring beans
into the melted snow water, and listened to the
simmering of the tea pot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Sandy retorted. &ldquo;I know now
why a goat can eat tin cans.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Constable Sloan did not wait for Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s
return before he called all hands to the
food he had prepared. Perhaps he sympathized with
the boys, but it was true he ate as hungrily as they
did, all the while telling them stories of his experiences
in the land of the long day and the long
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hardly seems possible we&rsquo;re actually seeing
the midnight sun,&rdquo; Dick said, when the edge was
off his appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way my eyes feel, I sure feel it&rsquo;s a fact.
Do your eyes feel strained and tired, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet they do. But how would it feel if we
had as strong sunlight as they do in the south?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d probably go blind,&rdquo; Sandy opined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s hardly a doubt about that,&rdquo; said Constable
Sloan. &ldquo;But wait till you experience the long
night, and see the moon go around and around in the
sky, for day after day, not seeing anything but the
stars, and then only when the sky is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll be up here that long?&rdquo; asked
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you never can tell,&rdquo; Constable Sloan replied
evasively, as if he had said more than he
intended.</p>
<p>After the meal the boys immediately crawled into
their sleeping bags and fell into a sound slumber.
They did not awaken when Corporal McCarthy returned,
several hours later, and did not know he had
returned until they were awakened to find the dogs
harnessed to the sledges and breakfast awaiting
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you wake us up so we could help
get ready to start?&rdquo; Dick asked the policemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a long hard trip ahead of us,&rdquo; returned
the Corporal, &ldquo;and you fellows needed your
rest. I found Mistak&rsquo;s trail two miles east of here.
He&rsquo;s started inland and not only that, but it looks
like he&rsquo;s crossed a glacier which seems to cover part
of the interior of the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; Dick turned to Sandy. &ldquo;We
may have to cross a glacier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me better than floating around among
these icebergs in a caribou hide boat,&rdquo; Sandy replied
with spirit. &ldquo;I like to have my feet under me, and
dry land under my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words you&rsquo;re a land lubber,&rdquo; laughed
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I am,&rdquo; admitted Sandy, strapping on his
snowshoes.</p>
<p>A little later the little company pulled out of camp,
and set off at a good pace, Corporal McCarthy in
the lead. After following the seashore a little way
they cut inland at an angle, and after about an
hour&rsquo;s sledging struck the trail made by a dog
team and three men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>At this point they made a halt while Corporal
McCarthy went ahead to look over the land before
they advanced. The reason for this move was
quickly evident, for towering over them, at a distance
of less than half a mile, was a mass of ice
that marked the beginning of a glacier, probably
miles and miles in extent.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy were awed by the very immensity
of the towering ice. The fact that they might find
it necessary to brave those treacherous heights on
the trail of the &ldquo;white Eskimo&rdquo; tested their courage
to the utmost. But the boys were not the sort that
back down when danger is close at hand. Truth to
tell, they loved action and danger more than was
good for their own safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes the Corporal,&rdquo; Dick called out
presently, his sharp eyes having caught sight of a
fur parka behind an ice hummock.</p>
<p>Presently the policeman came fully into view and
waved for them to come on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trail leads over the glacier,&rdquo; called the Corporal
when they were within hearing distance.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy hurried forward after the dogs,
their hearts hammering at the promise of the excitement
ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">ON THE GLACIER</span></h2>
<p>Immediately upon approaching the foot of the
glacier Dick and Sandy could see what a dangerous
struggle was to be theirs in attempting to scale the
mountain of ice. For hundreds of years the ice had
frozen there, layer upon layer, filled with great holes
and cracks, its own great weight forcing it to move
toward sea level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re ever going to climb it,&rdquo;
Sandy gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; admitted Dick, &ldquo;but Mistak
must have got to the top, and anything he can do,
the King&rsquo;s policemen can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heap big mountain ice,&rdquo; commented Toma.
&ldquo;Ketchum sore head if slide down to bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dick could not help but laugh at
Toma&rsquo;s remark in spite of the seriousness of the task
ahead of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; Constable Sloan came forward, interrupting
them, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to use man power
now. Here&rsquo;s a good chance for you fellows to test
your biceps. There are six of us, so that leaves three
to a sled. Sipsa, Toma and myself will take the
first sledge&mdash;that leaves you boys and the Corporal
for the second. It won&rsquo;t take much head work, but
lots of backbone. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy watched, with interest, the starting
of the first sledge up the steep incline, men and
dogs straining with every ounce of strength in them.
When at last they disappeared around a huge knob
of ice and snow, they sent a lusty cheer after them,
and set to work themselves to push their sledge up.</p>
<p>It took a half hour of pushing and hauling before
they reached a point that was level enough for them
to rest comfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much more of this and I&rsquo;ll turn to water,&rdquo; panted
Sandy, throwing back his parka and revealing the
perspiration standing out in huge drops that froze
almost as soon as they came in contact with the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better keep that parka over your head,&rdquo; cautioned
Corporal McCarthy. &ldquo;A little too much of
this air when you&rsquo;re overheated will frost your
lungs, and you know what that means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy remembered that frost bitten lungs often
brought on more serious ailments, and hurriedly
bundled up his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>An hour more of strenuous climbing brought them
to a point half way up the wall of the glacier. They
could see the first sledge going up far above them,
like a caterpillar tank, the dogs and men pushing and
pulling it appearing like so many ants hauling a gram
of wheat to their home hill.</p>
<p>Dick took a deep breath and looked down, grasping
Sandy&rsquo;s arm to call his attention to the vast
scene that lay below them. Far away they could see
the mainland which they had left the day before.
The open water glittered like diamonds where the
floating ice lay, and the beach of the island seemed
more like a ribbon than a piece of land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me dizzy,&rdquo; said Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but there&rsquo;s something inspiring about it,&rdquo;
returned Dick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s desolate and frozen and lonely,
but just the same it&rsquo;s beautiful because it&rsquo;s so clean
and white and still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you just about hit the nail on the head
that time,&rdquo; spoke up Corporal McCarthy, who was
standing just behind them. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s death in
that beauty. I hope you boys never have to see
all of what I mean. Now let&rsquo;s get to work on this
sledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Refreshed by their rest, the boys buckled down to
the job with a will, and for considerable distance all
went well as before. Then, when they were just
reaching a point where they might breathe again, the
rope which the policeman was pulling on broke loose
from the sledge, and with the shock of the freed
weight, Dick slipped, the sledge sliding back upon
Sandy who was pushing from behind. For an instant
the sturdy Scotch lad held the full weight of
the heavy sledge, then with a faint cry of dismay,
he started down, the sledge on top of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sandy!&rdquo; Dick gave a shout of anguish, as,
slipping and sliding, he held on to the rope he had
been pulling on.</p>
<p>Corporal McCarthy leaped down to Dick&rsquo;s aid,
but the sledge had gained momentum and, white
faced, they could only hang on hoping the sledge
would catch on the rough ice before it began to
turn over.</p>
<p>Faster and faster the sledge began to slide, pushing
Sandy before it, his shirt pinched under the runners,
and dragging the frantically struggling two
after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to stop it before it reaches the edge
of that shelf!&rdquo; cried Corporal McCarthy. &ldquo;If it
ever goes over the edge, Sandy is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they had started a miniature avalanche of ice
and snow by their struggles and this rolling along
underfoot made firm footing impossible to find.</p>
<p>One last heave they gave backward on the remaining
rope as the sledge struck the edge of the ice
shelf. They heard a heavy crash, then silence.</p>
<p>Dick looked up from where he clung to the steep
incline, the sledge rope clutched in his hands.
Stunned by fear for what had happened to Sandy,
who had disappeared, he watched Corporal McCarthy
pick his way cautiously down to the sledge. The
rear end of the runners had stuck in a fissure, bringing
the sledge to a stop not more than a foot from
the edge of the shelf below which they knew not
how far the drop was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>As if it were all a bad dream, Dick watched the
policeman look over the sledge, under it, and all
about, then lie down on his stomach and peer over
the shelf. The significance of that move and what
it might mean in regard to Sandy&rsquo;s fate, brought
Dick to his feet, and in two agile leaps he was at
the policeman&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>The drop under the shelf was only about twenty
feet, provided an object falling from it caught on a
second projection of ice and snow. Beyond that
there was a frightful depth to a small plateau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy! Sandy!&rdquo; Dick called at the top of his
voice.</p>
<p>Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s somber expression showed
that he thought there was little use in shouting, but
he presently uttered an exclamation of astonishment.</p>
<p>The snow on the lower shelf directly below the
point where the sledge had lodged, had moved!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Dick, in a glad shout.</p>
<p>From the snow on the shelf protruded one arm,
then another, and a moment later the snow plastered
figure of Sandy rose up, hip deep in soft snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on while I get a rope!&rdquo; shouted the Corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll haul you back up,&rdquo; seconded Dick. &ldquo;Are
you hurt much?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright,&rdquo; came Sandy&rsquo;s shout, a bit faint,
but welcomely spirited. &ldquo;Got a few bruises is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Corporal McCarthy was back with a rope,
and was paying it out over the shelf. Sandy quickly
got hold of his end and fastened it about his waist.
In a moment the combined strength of the two on
the ledge had hauled Sandy to the safety of the
shelf where the sledge had lodged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I was never so glad to see anybody in my
life!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, banging his chum on the
back with a lusty hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, watch out where you are hitting me,&rdquo; complained
Sandy. &ldquo;That sledge made me sore all over
when it shoved me down that bank. And, say, I
thought I was gone when I rolled over that shelf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lad, you&rsquo;re one of the luckiest fellows that ever
lived,&rdquo; Corporal McCarthy put in, &ldquo;but now let&rsquo;s tie
into this sledge again and not let those fellows ahead
of us beat us to the top too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour more of back-bending toil and they joined
Constable Sloan and the others, who already had
reached the top of the glacier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>While they all rested, Dick and Sandy looked
curiously about them. Level ice, covered with snow,
stretched for considerable distance on either hand.
Long, zigzag cracks, or fissures, formed curious
designs on the glacier&rsquo;s summit; while now and
again they could hear a deep rumble, like distant
thunder, which, Constable Sloan said, was due to
new cracks forming in the ice, and sometimes caused
by a fragment of the glacier breaking off and falling
into a fissure or into the sea far away across
the island.</p>
<p>Corporal McCarthy was not long in locating the
trail made by Fred Mistak&rsquo;s dog team. They had
taken virtually the same path up the wall of the
glacier that the fugitive had taken, and so were not
far off the trail.</p>
<p>Soon they were hurrying onward, carefully avoiding
the deep, dangerous chasms in the ice whenever
possible, and when necessary, bridging the narrow
cracks with their sledges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to fall into one of those cracks,&rdquo; Dick
said in a low voice to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Sandy agreed. &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s at
the bottom of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard there are rivers of running water
under these glaciers,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;and that scientists
have found the fossils of ancient animals in
the huge caves which the water forms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, just think! The land under this glacier
must be just like it was a hundred years ago. Makes
me feel creepy to think of those giant reptiles that
used to wander around right under where we&rsquo;re
walking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Dick was about to reply when Corporal McCarthy
stopped the teams at the edge of an expanse of ice
that had been swept clear of soft snow by water and
wind.</p>
<p>The boys quickly saw that Mistak&rsquo;s trail vanished
here, as if it had gone up in smoke. The ice was
as hard as flint, and sledge, dogs, and men had
passed over it without leaving a mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma, you stay with the dog team,&rdquo; ordered
Corporal McCarthy, &ldquo;the rest of us will scatter out
and circle this expanse of smooth ice. We can pick
up Mistak&rsquo;s trail where he strikes soft snow or brittle
ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan was carried out but after an hour&rsquo;s fruitless
search the Corporal called them all back to the
sledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we&rsquo;ve lost Mistak&rsquo;s trail for the
present. He must have made directly for this spot
knowing he could throw off the scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hard ice ends up in a lot of fissures and ice
caverns,&rdquo; spoke up Constable Sloan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible
the Eskimo may be hiding out in one of the caves,
waiting for us to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he is we&rsquo;ll fix that. I&rsquo;ll go on a little
way with you and when we get in among the ice
hummocks on the other side of this level stretch,
I&rsquo;ll drop out and watch for him to come out. The
rest of you go on across the glacier, and make camp
at some convenient spot. If I have any luck, I&rsquo;ll
overtake you and let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>After Corporal McCarthy had left them Dick and
Sandy found themselves following the sledge along
a ridge of snow covered stones and gravel which
ran along the ice cap farther than they could see.
Following this, they found the ice sloping steadily
downward, while the ridge, or moraine, rose steadily
higher. Presently they could see on the distant horizon
the blackish blue of the open sea, broken by the
massive crests of floating bergs.</p>
<p>The sky had become overcast in the last hour and
the temperature had fallen considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for a bad storm,&rdquo; Constable Sloan
announced, his voice betraying some anxiety. &ldquo;As
soon as we get down to the seashore we&rsquo;ll build some
tight igloos. Tents won&rsquo;t stand the wind that&rsquo;s
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later they eased the sledge down a last
steep incline and found easier going at the foot of
the long ridge of glacial drift that had now grown
to massive proportions. The glacier proper was now
behind and on their left, beyond the ridge. They
had crossed only a fragment of it in reaching what
they believed to be the northern shore of a large
island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Sandy, over there on that big floe to the
northeast!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, pointing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s eyes followed Dick&rsquo;s directing finger and
widened at what he saw. A large herd of seals
dotted the ice and adjacent water. Now and again
the animals dived into the water, throwing up a
shower of spray. Faintly, as they drew nearer, they
could hear the grunting barks of the adult seals.</p>
<p>Sipsa seemed excited at the proximity of the
seal herd, and began jabbering to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he saying?&rdquo; Dick asked Constable
Sloan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means that here is good hunting, and that
he ought to tell his people about it. The Eskimos
depend altogether for their food upon hunting, and
when there&rsquo;s game and good weather they consider
it the same as sacrilege to procrastinate. They
can&rsquo;t figure out why a white man wastes his time
doing anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first signs of the coming storm interrupted
Constable Sloan. A fine hard sleet came sifting
down out of the leaden sky, cutting their faces like
hundreds of tiny knives.</p>
<p>Reaching a large drift that appeared ideal for
making igloo blocks, Constable Sloan called a halt,
and everyone set to work cutting snow blocks with
the long knives brought along for that purpose.</p>
<p>By the time they had completed two igloos, a
wind had sprung up and the sleet had thickened.
Though the huge glacial ridge shielded them from
the full force of the wind, still it shipped and
whirled with such force that they had to seek the
shelter of their lately built snow houses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope McCarthy doesn&rsquo;t get caught out in this
blizzard,&rdquo; said Constable Sloan when they were
squatted about a camp stove, crowded into one igloo
for added warmth. &ldquo;He ought to be coming in any
time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were in considerable suspense for several
minutes, until, outside, above the howling of the
wind, they heard Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s booming
shout. Constable Sloan hurried out and helped into
the igloo an almost unrecognizable figure. The Corporal
was covered with clinging ice from head to
foot and resembled some gigantic snow man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mistak didn&rsquo;t show himself if he really
was in hiding on the glacier,&rdquo; reported the Corporal.
&ldquo;The storm drove me in or I&rsquo;d have waited longer.
Tomorrow, if the storm lulls, we&rsquo;ll look again. The
trouble is all traces of his sledge will be covered up
by this storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better establish a base of supplies here,&rdquo;
advised Constable Sloan. &ldquo;The boys can do some
hunting to help out on the meat problem, while we
comb the island for Mistak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s face took on a disappointed expression
at this announcement, and he looked at Dick as if
he wanted him to do something. But Dick shook his
head, and presently whispered mysteriously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a hunch we&rsquo;re not going to lose out on
the man hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy had to be satisfied with that until he got
Dick alone and pumped him for details.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>That night the boys slept the sleep of utter weariness,
while the storm beat and buffeted futilely at
the dome of their warm igloo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">SIPSA VANISHES</span></h2>
<p>It was two days before the blizzard died down
and the little snowbound company were permitted
to leave their Eskimo houses for any length of time.
Dick and Sandy found almost a new world awaiting
them when they burrowed like two badgers out of
their snug retreat into the polar sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the sledges and dogs?&rdquo; Sandy wanted
to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see everything has been buried?&rdquo; Dick
retorted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some tall snow shoveling to do
before we can get at our supplies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constable Sloan soon found the dogs. Each of
the faithful creatures was deep in a nest of snow,
with only a tiny hole to breathe through. The beasts
were gaunt with hunger, and whined and slavered at
the mouth while the policeman began digging out the
supplies.</p>
<p>It took several hours of hard work to dig out the
camp, and when everything was in good shape, Corporal
McCarthy drew the boys aside:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Constable Sloan and myself are going back on
the glacier with ten days&rsquo; supplies to see if we can&rsquo;t
pick up Mistak&rsquo;s trail again. We&rsquo;ll leave you with
Sipsa to take care of the camp and do some hunting.
Sipsa will show you how to kill and cut up seals and
walruses, which we&rsquo;ll need for dog meat if we don&rsquo;t
have to eat them ourselves before we finish our job
up here. Don&rsquo;t overlook the musk-oxen. We saw
signs of them on the island and they&rsquo;re about the
best eating a white man can find up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we see Mistak. What do you want us
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay low and keep out of trouble,&rdquo; cautioned the
policeman. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back in ten days at least and
whatever you&rsquo;ve discovered about Mistak&rsquo;s whereabouts
we&rsquo;ll put to good use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policemen soon had a sledge of supplies and
one dog team ready for the trail. Waving farewell
to the boys they started out, disappearing up the long
slope that led to the glacier. In one way Dick and
Sandy were glad to be free to command their own
movements, yet again, with the experienced policemen
gone, the vast frozen land presented an even
more sinister appearance. A hundred forebodings
surged up in the breasts of Dick and Sandy, but they
manfully fought them down, preparing immediately
to go seal hunting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Sipsa had brought along several harpoons, and he
began working on these diligently. He made the
boys understand by signs that he was not yet ready
to go seal hunting, and they left him alone after
growing tired of watching the Eskimo&rsquo;s deft fingers
manipulating a whetting stone.</p>
<p>Dick suggested that they go down to the sea shore,
and all three of the boys set off in that direction.
They found the tide rising, and for half an hour
amused themselves by skipping stones across the
shallow water, and throwing at the small ice cakes
floating farther out. Dick and Toma were about
tied at hitting their mark, but Sandy was far the
more expert at skipping stones. The Scotch lad could
skip a choice flat stone as far again as he could
throw it, and though Dick and Toma tried again
and again to equal Sandy&rsquo;s prowess, they finally
were forced to give up, so tired were their arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk along the shore a ways,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;We may find something interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hundred yards farther on they passed out of
sight of the camp, and ran into a flock of eider ducks
who took to the water upon their approach with the
prettiest nose dives they had ever seen. Toma&rsquo;s
sharp eyes located some nests on the shore, and they
procured a few fresh eggs and a good many old
ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the old eggs where they are,&rdquo; Dick said,
as Sandy was about to see how far he could throw
one. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to destroy what will be little
eider ducks some day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Dick,&rdquo; Sandy agreed. &ldquo;I just
didn&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him nice an&rsquo; soft&mdash;make um warm nest,&rdquo; Toma
spoke up, running his fingers around in one of the
duck nests.</p>
<p>Dick picked up some of the fine, white feathers
with which the nest was lined. &ldquo;Yes, these are about
as soft feathers as are known. The Eskimos gather
and trade them to the white men for tools and
things. In the United States we call it eiderdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wandered on down the shore to the point
where the great glacial ridge west of their camp
extended into the sea. The ridge sloped off into the
water in a long slope at the foot of which the waves
rumbled and thundered, dashing the huge icebergs
this way and that as if they were toys. Occasionally
they could hear the distant noises of the glacier as
fragments of it fell into the sea, or when its slow
movements caused huge cracks to form in its depths.</p>
<p>Dick led the way a short distance up the slope
toward a dark knob that was sticking up through
the snow and ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that isn&rsquo;t one of the meteors they
say are in the polar regions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Robert
Peary, the great explorer, brought back some fine
specimens to American museums. This does look
like it might be a very small one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stopped at the protuberance and inspected it
curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like melted iron to me,&rdquo; Sandy declared.
&ldquo;Is that what meteors are made of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a form of iron,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s called
meteoric iron. Scientists claim it is about the
hardest iron which has been found in a natural
state. In the sky it is heated to a liquid state by the
friction of falling through the air, then when it
strikes the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere it cools suddenly and
explodes with a loud report, lighting up the country
for miles and miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do more meteors fall in the polar regions
than in the other zones?&rdquo; inquired Sandy, meditatively
fingering the meteoric rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember having read the exact reason,
and I&rsquo;m not sure that more do fall up here, but if
there are more it must be because the atmosphere
is so much colder. The meteors explode much higher
in the sky, then lose their velocity and so fall to the
earth&rsquo;s surface near the pole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the glacier seems to have pushed this
meteor up here,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;so there&rsquo;s no telling
where it actually fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;but say, this big
stone gives me an idea. Let&rsquo;s gather some big rocks
and build a monument here, leaving some kind of
record inside of it. That&rsquo;s the way all the Arctic
explorers did. They called them cairns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Sandy and Toma quickly showed how enthusiastic
they were by starting to gather stones of a good
size. These they built up in a solid circle near the
meteor until they had an erection about a foot high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the record,&rdquo; said Dick, and drew from
his pocket a small calendar with which he had been
keeping track of the days. Sandy dug down in the
ample pockets of his caribou hide shirt and found
a soft-nosed rifle cartridge. With a hunting knife
they trimmed this to a point, improvising a crude
lead pencil. Then on the back of the card board
that had supported the calendar leaves, Dick wrote
under the day and year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We are on an uncharted island, a few hundred miles west
of Greenland, near the Arctic Circle. This is the farthest
north we have ever been in the service of the Royal Northwest
Mounted Police, or the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. If something
happens and we never return, anyone who reads this will know
just about where we were when we disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under this, all three of the boys proudly signed
their names, Toma painfully inscribing his to the
accompaniment of a twisting tongue, which he
chewed industriously at every move of the pencil.</p>
<p>When the record was finished Dick folded it carefully
and stowed it in the center of the cairn, placing
a heavy stone upon it. Then they gathered more
stones and built up the cairn to a height of about
five feet, rounding it off nicely at the top, forming a
receptacle for the record that would stand for years
and years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time we were getting back to camp
the way my stomach feels,&rdquo; Dick said when they had
finished, and were standing off at a distance appraising
their handiwork.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s and Toma&rsquo;s stomachs seemed to agree
perfectly with Dick&rsquo;s and so they started off on the
back trail, glancing over their shoulders every now
and then at the cairn.</p>
<p>By the time they reached camp their appetites had
grown immensely, and they voiced the hope that
Sipsa would have something prepared to eat. But
there was no smell of hot tea or frying meat. In
fact, as they approached they could see no sign whatever
of the Eskimo guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be in one of the igloos,&rdquo; Dick hazarded.</p>
<p>But a search of the igloos disclosed no Sipsa.
The boys shouted his name, but only a faint echo
from the wall of the ridge answered them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the harpoons he was working on when
we left,&rdquo; Sandy announced presently, after they had
looked more carefully about the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he must not be far away, but still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Dick&rsquo;s mind turned to the trouble they had had with
Okewah and Ootanega. &ldquo;I wonder if he found some
sign of the white Eskimo and was frightened away
like the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Sipsa didn&rsquo;t seem so superstitious as those
two,&rdquo; Sandy contended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so, too, until now. Anyway, we&rsquo;ll not
worry about it until we get something under our
belts to worry on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Sandy volunteered to act as cook and with the
addition of the fresh eider duck eggs he had gathered,
a very satisfying meal was prepared.</p>
<p>Sipsa had not yet put in an appearance when the
boys finished the last scrap of food, and Dick suggested
they search farther for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe um white Eskimo git him,&rdquo; Toma suggested
gruesomely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might be right,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;It would
be just like that villain to ambush our guide. But I
believe Sipsa was pretty well able to take care of
himself. He seemed much smarter than the average
native, and I believe he&rsquo;s more civilized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy chose to stay behind when Dick announced
that someone must watch the camp while they sought
the whereabouts of Sipsa, and Dick and Toma
started off with their rifles. At first they circled
the entire camp, looking for the prints of Eskimo
sealskin boots or his snowshoes. They found no
signs, however, and came to a halt on the sledge trail
made by the policemen hours before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Sipsa followed the sledge path,&rdquo; Dick
said, as Toma and he stood there contemplating the
next move. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re good at trailing, Toma; see if
you can&rsquo;t find out whether three instead of two pairs
of snowshoes followed this sledge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Toma bent over, his keen eyes glancing hither
and thither along the packed snow. Only a moment
he studied, then he straightened up. &ldquo;Three pair
snowshoes go long here,&rdquo; he declared positively.</p>
<p>Dick had perfect confidence in Toma&rsquo;s judgment,
and was sure they had found just the direction taken
by Sipsa when he left the camp. As the policemen
had departed over the same path over which they
had crossed the island, Dick believed it possible that
Sipsa might have taken it into his head to return
to his people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow his tracks for a ways,&rdquo; he voiced
his decision at last. &ldquo;I want to make sure that Sipsa
stuck to the back trail. If he hasn&rsquo;t turned off half
way up the glacier, then I&rsquo;m pretty certain he&rsquo;s decided
to go back to his people. In that case he has
such a start on us that about all we can do is let him
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this purpose in mind Dick and Toma started
out along the sledge trail. An hour&rsquo;s steady travel
without mishap failed to discover any deviation in
Sipsa&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may run into the policemen,&rdquo; Dick finally
spoke. &ldquo;If he does, they&rsquo;ll send him back in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think him go home alright,&rdquo; was Toma&rsquo;s brief
reply. &ldquo;Mebbe him no like work for white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was a good one, Toma,&rdquo; Dick grinned.
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be quitting us next.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The young Indian turned a pair of black inscrutable
eyes upon the white lad, for whom he had
risked his life so often. Dick could feel that he was
rebuked without hearing Toma say a word. He
stretched out his hand and placed it on the Indian
boy&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it, Toma, honest I
didn&rsquo;t. I was only joking. I know you&rsquo;d never
desert Sandy and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost of a smile traced the young Indian&rsquo;s
dark face and Dick knew that Toma had forgiven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much use going any further,&rdquo;
Dick resumed after an interval of silence. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to leave Sandy alone too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were just about to turn back when something
attracted Toma&rsquo;s keen eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop heap quick!&rdquo; ejaculated Toma under his
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think um fox. Him watch us from top big rock
up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see him now,&rdquo; Dick replied eagerly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
only about a hundred yards off, too. We need that
pelt. Let&rsquo;s both get a bead on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quietly the two knelt on their snowshoes and
leveled their rifles. Crack! Crack! the rifle shots
echoed in the hills.</p>
<p>The fox leaped high in the air, and ran like a
streak toward the top of the slope where he had
been sighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him have it again!&rdquo; cried Dick, firing
rapidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s reloading lever was working as fast as
Dick&rsquo;s and a veritable hail of lead was kicking up
the snow about the fleeing fox.</p>
<p>Just when the young hunters felt they had failed
to bring down the fox, the animal whirled and began
to bite himself, as if something had stung him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got um,&rdquo; grunted Toma.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the fox dropped to his side and
after kicking spasmodically for a few seconds remained
still. One or more of their bullets had
reached the mark and together the boys hastened
up the slope to examine their kill.</p>
<p>They found the animal to be a fine specimen of
the northern blue fox, with whose skin the Eskimos
trimmed many of their warmest fur garments.</p>
<p>Toma drew his hunting knife from its sheath and
began methodically to skin the fox, while Dick stood
by admiring the beauty of the fur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could take that pelt home to mother,&rdquo;
he said half to himself.</p>
<p>Toma looked up and sniffed. &ldquo;Huh, why you
take um blue fox for your mother? Wait till you
ketch um seal. Him worth heap more. I give my
sister black fox skin robe one time. She use um
for wipe feet on by door. She like um red wool
blanket best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had a hearty laugh at Toma&rsquo;s expense, but
the young Indian could not see anything funny in
what he had said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>However, the lads started back to camp on the
best of terms, carrying the blue fox pelt with them.</p>
<p>When they came in sight of the igloos they were
wholly unprepared for what met their eyes. Speechless
and terror stricken they stood and stared.</p>
<p>Two huge polar bears were mauling and crushing
the igloos and camp paraphernalia, and Sandy
was nowhere to be seen!</p>
<p>Even the dogs had run away before the attack
of the ferocious brutes, now apparently enjoying
their game of destruction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">AN INDIAN BEDTIME STORY</span></h2>
<p>Several moments passed before Dick could recover
his presence of mind, so great was the shock
he had received upon discovering the savage marauders
that were destroying their camp. A vision
of Sandy&rsquo;s mangled form sprang up in his mind, and
he covered his eyes and groaned. But he was not
one to let mere imagination long affect him when
action was needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the bear on the right, Toma,&rdquo; his voice
came clear and steady. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll probably attack us
as soon as we fire. Ready, aim, fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report of the rifles and the sting of the well
placed bullets brought the polar bears back on their
haunches, and they whirled to face whatever enemy
had attacked them. But Dick and Toma had fallen
on their stomachs in the snow immediately after
firing, and the bears could not see them. The great
beasts turned and renewed their wrecking of the
camp dunnage, whereupon Dick gave the order to
fire again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Now badly wounded, and puzzled because they
could not see where the burning missiles came from,
the bears began lumbering around in a circle, growling
savagely.</p>
<p>Dick and Toma fired once more from their prone
and hidden position and the bears decided the territory
was too hot for them. Leaving a trail of blood
drops behind them, they trotted off up the slope of
the glacial ridge, disappearing among the numerous
boulders strewn upon the slope.</p>
<p>No more were the bears gone than Dick and Toma
rushed to the torn up camp, calling Sandy&rsquo;s name.
At first there was no reply and in the death-like stillness
Dick felt an icy chill of horror steal over him
as once more he imagined what had befallen Sandy.
Then, very faintly, there came an answering shout,
seeming to come out of the snow-smothered earth
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, where are you!&rdquo; Dick cried gladly, looking
everywhere but failing to see any sign of his
chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, and I&rsquo;ll be with you,&rdquo; came the
voice again, unmistakably Sandy&rsquo;s but for some reason
half-choked and indistinct.</p>
<p>Then, out of a big snowdrift a hundred yards
from camp, popped Sandy, covered from head to
foot with snow. Dick and Toma ran to meet him,
overjoyed at his safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought those bears had finished you sure,&rdquo;
Dick said, much relieved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they weren&rsquo;t far from doing just that,&rdquo;
Sandy retorted drily. &ldquo;I was looking through the
packs for a tin of tea, a little while ago, when I felt
that something was behind me. I looked around and
there were those two bears looking at me as if they
were hungry. They weren&rsquo;t more than thirty feet
from me, and I&rsquo;d left my rifle in the igloo. You can
bet I didn&rsquo;t stand in that spot very long. I made a
flying start right straight ahead, and when I reached
those holes in the snow where the dogs have been
sleeping, I dived head first right into a big one, and
dug myself further in. Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t scared. I
expected every minute to hear those bears digging in
after me. About when I was pretty near smothered
in the snow I heard you start shooting. Say, you
came just in time. I&rsquo;d have suffocated in that burrow
in about two minutes more. And I believe I&rsquo;d
have passed out right there rather than show myself
to those bears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to keep your rifle close to you after
this,&rdquo; Dick cautioned, though now that the danger
was over he was amused at Sandy&rsquo;s excited relating
of his unique escape from the bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear meat heap good eat,&rdquo; Toma spoke up.
&ldquo;Maybe one them bear die somewhere in rocks. We
go see, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life,&rdquo; Sandy declared emphatically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen all the bears I want to for to-day. I&rsquo;ll
be dreaming about bears chewing on me for a
month.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Dick laughed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you, Sandy, but
I think Toma&rsquo;s idea about following the bears is a
good one. We need meat, you know, and you can
see by the blood on the snow around here that one
of them at least might have been wounded bad
enough so that he&rsquo;ll die later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you fellows go ahead. I think I&rsquo;ve
had about all the trouble I&rsquo;m going to have today,
so you needn&rsquo;t worry about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you have, alright,&rdquo; Dick called over his
shoulder as he set out after the bears. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t
be gone long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma and Dick followed the plain trail left by
the bears clear up the ridge to the east of the camp.
But they did not catch sight of their quarry until
they were some distance out on the flank of the glacier
on the other side of the ridge.</p>
<p>The young Indian then called Dick&rsquo;s attention to
a movement ahead of them. They saw one of the
bears climbing to the top of a heap of ice, and
crouched in hiding until the great beast had passed
out of sight. Though they waited several minutes,
a second bear did not appear, and so they thought
it safe to go on.</p>
<p>Not far from where they had sighted the one bear
they discovered why the other had not appeared.
He lay stone dead in a little hollow in the ice. An
examination showed that two of their bullets had
pierced the animal&rsquo;s lungs. Only an animal of iron
stamina could have traveled so far with such serious
wounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Cutting a huge haunch of steak from the bear&rsquo;s
hindquarters, the young hunters started back, their
mouths already watering in anticipation of fresh
bear steak.</p>
<p>It was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock by Dick&rsquo;s watch when
they reached the igloos once more, to find that Sandy
had been busy in their absence and had repaired
much of the damage done by the polar bears.</p>
<p>Two hours later, snug in a warm igloo, Sandy requested
Toma to tell them a bedtime story from his
stock of Indian lore. Toma acquiesced willingly,
and began in his broken, yet simple expressive
English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long, long time ago, young Indian brave, by
name Swift Foot, live by big water, by name Great
Slave Lake. He very handsome brave. Him mother
love him very much. His father great hunter. He
have all food he can eat, warm wigwam in winter.
No have to work. Him play all day, and when him
tired he sleep. But him no happy. He look at
stars and want know why the stars twinkle; him
look at sun, want know why sun warm; him look
at moon, want know why cannot reach it; him
look at rainbow, want know why cannot catch him
no matter how fast he run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Swift Foot ask mother questions. She say, &lsquo;Big
Eagle, your father, great hunter and very wise. He
tell you, my son.&rsquo; Swift Foot ask father questions.
Father say, &lsquo;Your grandfather old and wise, maybe
he can tell you.&rsquo; Swift Foot ask his grandfather
questions, but old man say he not know these things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye an&rsquo; bye Swift Foot visit all old men in tribe,
but none knew why stars twinkle, why sun shine,
why he no can catch rainbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swift Foot, him get very unhappy. Him no
eat, no sleep. His mother think him going die. One
day she tell him, &lsquo;Swift Foot, you follow big water
north till you come to great river. There you find
old, old medicine man. He tell you why stars twinkle,
why sun shine, why no catch rainbow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swift Foot him very glad then. Him jump in
birch canoe an&rsquo; paddle fast. Many days him paddle
along lake shore till he come to great river. When
he come to shore old, old man, all dried up, waiting
there to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Indian boy ask old medicine man what he
want know, old man ask him what he give to know
all things. Swift Foot, he say he give everything
he have. Medicine man ask him if he sure. Swift
Foot say yes, he give everything to know, for he
no want live longer if he can no catch rainbow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then medicine man build big fire and boil something
in pot, while he dance round and round Swift
Foot. After while Swift Foot feel strange. He feel
like he getting smaller; he cannot see far with his
eyes; him hands shake like leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon fire make big smoke&mdash;puff, puff.
Smoke disappear, and old man, he gone. Swift Foot
all alone on shore of big water, and he know all
things. He know why stars twinkle, why sun shines,
why he can no catch rainbow. He know so much he
much afraid. He jump up, try to run to canoe. But
he fall down hard. He get up, try to run again, but
he no can run&mdash;he have to walk very slow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he get down to big water it is like mirror.
He bend over and look down. Old, old man
look back at him from water, oldest an&rsquo; ugliest man
he ever see. He know then him give youth for great
wisdom. No more him run an&rsquo; jump, no more him
eat deer meat, for he have no teeth. He begin weep,
an&rsquo; say he no want know all things, him want be
young again. All day, all night he cry, but he not
grow young again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he paddle his canoe back to his mother, but
she not know him. She laugh when he say he Swift
Foot, her son. &lsquo;My son beautiful young boy, you
ugly, old man,&rsquo; she say. &lsquo;Go &rsquo;way.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Swift Foot leave village then. Him go far away
in forest where no man see him. One moon he no
eat anything, but pray much to Great Spirit. Then
him fall asleep. When wake up him feel strong
again. He go down to pool of water and look in.
Him jump up and make big, glad noise with mouth.
Great Spirit answer prayer. Him young again.
But he not remember why stars twinkle, why sun
shines, why no can catch rainbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swift Foot go back to his mother. She very
glad to see him. He say to his mother he very happy
now; him no want know why stars twinkle, why
sun shines, why no can catch rainbow. He say he
love them just the same. Many years him live happy.
Make big hunter like him father, but him never wish
for what he no can get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that was a great story!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed.
&ldquo;Who told you that one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; Toma replied briefly, and for an
instant the boys thought they detected the sparkle
of tears in the dark eyes of the stoical young Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That story had a moral to it just like one of
Aesop&rsquo;s Fables,&rdquo; Dick said sleepily, as he crawled
into his sleeping bag. &ldquo;Guess we can&rsquo;t have our cake
and eat it too. Right, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a long, tuneful snore was the only reply Dick
heard from Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The boys slept soundly for nearly ten hours, and
when they awakened they felt equal to any task
that might present itself. First, they visited the bear
Dick and Toma had killed the day before, and
brought back all the meat they could carry on their
backs. Since this left them well supplied with meat
for themselves, Dick decided they had better make
an effort to procure some seal or walrus meat for
the dogs.</p>
<p>Toma once more was elected to remain behind
while Dick and Sandy went hunting. The boys
found that the seal herd had moved a considerable
distance eastward along the coast since they first had
seen it. It took them an hour of climbing over
rough shore ice before they reached a point opposite
the seal herd. Even then, to their disappointment,
they found that several large ice floes, jammed together,
separated them from the seals.</p>
<p>After some minutes of deliberation, they decided
to venture out upon the ice, and get nearer the seals
by jumping from one cake of ice to another. Thus
they began a dangerous adventure, destined from the
beginning to end in ill fortune, for they had not
gone a hundred yards across the treacherous ice
before both Dick and Sandy had slipped and narrowly
saved themselves from a bad ducking, if not
drowning, by clutching the edge of the floe which
had been their objective when they leaped the open
water.</p>
<p>Resting on a large, secure floe, they noticed that
the tide was going out and that frequently, from
the outer edge of the ice-jam, a large fragment detached
itself and floated out to sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to go back,&rdquo; Dick said once,
but they did not want to turn back empty handed
after having gone so far, so they kept on until they
were within fifty feet of the nearest seals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How tame they are!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem just like dogs,&rdquo; Dick added. &ldquo;Probably
no one has killed any of this herd for a long
time. It seems a shame to shoot such innocent looking
creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know we have to have food for the
dogs,&rdquo; Sandy argued with his tender heart. &ldquo;In this
country it&rsquo;s eat or be eaten, and we need the dogs and
not the seals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, suppose you shoot the first one,&rdquo;
Dick said a little sarcastically.</p>
<p>Sandy tightened his lips, raised his rifle and took
aim at the head of a fine young seal. Just then a
baby seal flopped away from its mother&rsquo;s side, directly
on a line with Sandy&rsquo;s sights. The baby seal
stood up on its flippers and looked at the boys as
cute as could be.</p>
<p>Sandy expelled his breath in a disgusted gasp, and
let his rifle fall to his hip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave boy,&rdquo; taunted Dick in fun. &ldquo;If I wanted
turkey for Thanksgiving I wouldn&rsquo;t send you out to
chop off its head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; admitted Sandy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt
this way before, but not so much as now. I don&rsquo;t
see how anyone can slaughter these animals by the
hundreds even if their skins are so valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Just then a big bull seal crawled up on the ice out
of the water, making an angry noise in his throat.
This old fellow was quite fierce looking and did not
apparently take kindly to the presence of the boys.
He reared up and fixed baleful eyes upon them,
opening his huge, whiskered mouth to show his
tusks.</p>
<p>Neither of the boys felt the same sympathy for
this new and hostile arrival, and Dick quickly raised
his rifle and brought down the bull with one shot.</p>
<p>At the sound of the rifle almost all of the seals
took to the water hastily, swimming about and
watching the man creatures from a distance. But
the old bull did not move from where he had fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next problem is how are we going to get this
big brute ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I never thought of that. I wonder how much
he weighs,&rdquo; said Sandy, going forward and trying
to lift the dead animal.</p>
<p>But the combined strength of both Dick and
Sandy was only sufficient to drag the heavy body
slowly across the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must weigh several hundred pounds,&rdquo; Dick
eyed their kill appraisingly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever
get him ashore, unless we cut him up and carry him
in pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>So intent were the boys on the problem at hand
that they had for several minutes lost all thought of
their rather dangerous situation. It was Sandy who
first discovered something wrong. It seemed to him
the ice on which they stood was moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, quick!&rdquo; his voice was hoarse with fear.
&ldquo;This floe has broken away from the shore ice.
What shall we do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick wheeled toward the shore, taking in their
predicament at a glance. &ldquo;Run for it, Sandy. We
may reach the gap before it&rsquo;s too wide to jump!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">ADRIFT ON A FLOE</span></h2>
<p>When Dick and Sandy ran for the edge of the
moving floe which was nearest the shore, they realized
what might happen to them should they fail to
jump the widening stretch of water between them
and safety. With the tide going out, they would be
carried out into a sea where no ships sailed, and
where they could expect no help from any friendly,
inhabited shores.</p>
<p>The floe which was carrying them off was fully
three hundred yards across, and since they had been
tardy in discovering their peril, they found fate
against them. Coming to a sudden stop at the edge
of the floe, they saw, with sinking hearts, that more
than a hundred yards of icy salt water separated
them from the floes that still were clinging to the
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we swim it?&rdquo; cried Sandy desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Dick returned grimly. &ldquo;Not with these
heavy clothes on. We&rsquo;d drown or freeze before
we&rsquo;d gone a third of the distance. Sandy, we&rsquo;re
trapped!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>It did not take Sandy long to see that Dick was
right. Alone, with a dead seal, upon a large ice floe,
each second increased their peril as they floated farther
away from shore. Death by freezing might
be their lot, for without shelter they could not hope
to weather a polar storm. Even if they were fortunate
in experiencing mild weather, they would
eventually starve.</p>
<p>In a dejected mood the two boys stood watching
the bleak shore line that now seemed so warm and
friendly since they had been cut off from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you notice the current is carrying us westward
as well as north?&rdquo; Dick spoke up presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I can see you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; rejoined Sandy.
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we keep drifting at this angle, we&rsquo;ll sight our
camp and maybe we can signal Toma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s face brightened for an instant, then he
gave in again to his former forebodings. &ldquo;Toma
can&rsquo;t do anything for us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not right away. At least he&rsquo;ll know what
has happened to us, and can notify the policemen
when they return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy realized the wisdom in Dick&rsquo;s words, and
sat down to watch for the first sign of their camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The floe slowly turned as it was carried along with
the ocean current, and the boys were forced to change
their position frequently in order to stay on the
side nearest the shore. And since their huge raft
was floating out to sea as well as westward past the
camp site, it became a problem as to whether they
would not be too far away to signal Toma when
that moment came.</p>
<p>Tensely they waited. For twenty minutes the floe
forged along with its human cargo before Dick
suddenly gave a glad shout. At a distance of about
half a mile, the igloos of their camp appeared, surrounded
by the tiny dark dots which represented
the sledges and other dunnage. But there was no
sign of life.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy pointed their rifles into the air
and emptied the magazines. But the shots brought
no figure tumbling out of one of the far away igloos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s inside and can&rsquo;t hear us. If he does he&rsquo;ll
probably think we&rsquo;re shooting seals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fire more shots,&rdquo; Sandy suggested.</p>
<p>They reloaded and repeated their first salvo, with
no better results. Slowly the igloos grew smaller
and smaller as they floated farther out to sea, and at
last they sat down and gave up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Toma couldn&rsquo;t have helped us anyway,&rdquo;
Dick said, trying to make the best of their misfortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it would make me feel a lot better if I
knew someone knew what had happened to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick agreed and fell silent, wracking his brain
for a way out. But the more he thought it over, the
more certain he became that they were in the hands
of fate. Nothing but a miracle could save them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>They had not been at sea an hour until a new peril
presented itself. The ice floe upon which they had
been marooned was breaking up. Large segments began
cracking away from the main body and floating
off by themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must stay together, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick said,
&ldquo;Suppose one of those cracks came between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy shivered at the thought and eyed the ice
under his feet. Holding hands, the boys walked to
the center of the floe where the ice seemed the
thickest.</p>
<p>The shore was now only a dim line to the south,
while around rose and fell the icy waves of the desolate
polar sea. Here and there a berg wallowed
along and occasionally they collided with a slower
moving body of ice. Dick thought of jumping off
the floe to one of the bergs, but changed his mind
since the faster moving floe might possibly run into
land while the loggy iceberg would float in almost
the same place for days.</p>
<p>Adding to the danger of their situation, the sky
was becoming overcast by a film of gray clouds and
a freezing wind was springing up, heightening the
waves and throwing icy cold spray across the floe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for a storm, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick said, beating
his arms against his body to keep warm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
up to us to fix up some sort of wind break or else we
can&rsquo;t stand the cold. Think we can chop some cakes
of ice out of this floe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;We sure can try,&rdquo; responded Sandy, drawing
out his sheath knife with alacrity.</p>
<p>Both boys then set to work industriously and after
considerable hard labor, succeeded in chipping out
some good sized chunks of ice. These they built up
in a half circle, rounded against the wind. Against
the wall they flung water with their mittens. The
water quickly froze, cementing the blocks together
and forming an effective wind break. Behind this
they hovered while the wind increased in velocity
and a heavy snow began to fall.</p>
<p>They dared not sleep for fear they would freeze
before they awoke, and though the dread drowsiness
that is the first symptom of freezing stole over them
again and again, they fought it off grimly. Once
both fell asleep at the same time in spite of all they
could do, but the fast moving floe struck a large berg
with a grinding, rending crash and startled them to
the temporary safety of wakefulness. Had it not
been for the wind break they had erected they would
undoubtedly have frozen to death. As it was, they
were forced to watch each other, to prevent sleep
coming to both at the same time. Sometimes Dick
pounded Sandy until his eyes opened, and again
Sandy beat and shouted at Dick above the roar of
the storm, and the crashing and grinding of ice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Neither had the least idea where they were being
driven to, they had even lost all sense of direction,
every effort bent on keeping a spark of life burning
in their numb bodies.</p>
<p>It seemed to the boys that the battle with the cold
would never end, that they had floated in the storm
for hours, when suddenly the floe came to a jarring
stop, and a deluge of ice water rolled across it,
almost washing Dick and Sandy from their position
under the wind break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what we&rsquo;ve hit!&rdquo; Dick shouted
hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a berg,&rdquo; Sandy cried in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we aren&rsquo;t moving at all,&rdquo; Dick shouted back.</p>
<p>Believing they might have been washed ashore on
some island, the boys braved the full force of the
storm and staggered out of their wind break to investigate.
The snow and spray almost blinded them,
but at last they made out a huge mass of ice upon
which the floe had lodged. It rose up for nearly
fifty feet and withstood every charge of the gigantic
waves that crashed against it.</p>
<p>Yet, in the brief period when the wind cleared the
air of flying snow, they could see the swell of waves
beyond the ice which was holding them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grounded berg!&rdquo; Dick shouted at last, and
Sandy and he fought their way back to the welcome
shelter of their wind break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be pretty close to land,&rdquo; Sandy opined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but there&rsquo;s no telling how deep the water
is here. The berg we&rsquo;ve lodged on may extend down
into the water for a hundred feet. There&rsquo;s always
more of a berg under water than there is above.
We&rsquo;ve got to stick it out until this storm blows over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they renewed their struggle to fight off the
gnawing cold, cheered somewhat by the probabilities
that when the storm blew over they would see land.</p>
<p>It was two hours later when the wind slackened
perceptibly and the snow ceased to fall. With shouts
of joy the boys then saw, about a mile away, across
the dashing waves, a line of black cliffs, streaked
with snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if we could only find some way to float in
on those breakers. But I don&rsquo;t see how we could
take a chance on a cake of ice. We couldn&rsquo;t stick
to it a second before we got washed off into the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait till the waves die down,&rdquo;
Sandy said. &ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t so weak, maybe we could
paddle a chunk of ice then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick shook his head. &ldquo;That might do in a story
book, but even if we weren&rsquo;t just about ready to
drop, we couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glumly, they began the wait for the waves to go
down, tightening their belts upon flat and gnawing
stomachs. With the ceasing of the storm their hunger
became three times as noticeable. Had the dead
seal, which had first accompanied them on the floe,
still been with them, they might have tackled raw
blubber, but the waves had washed the seal into the
sea long before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Though the wind had fallen, the boys found themselves
little more comfortable, for the temperature
began to fall alarmingly. With the passing of every
hour the still air grew colder while the waves quieted
under the iron hand of Jack Frost.</p>
<p>The boys chewed ice to cool their thirsting mouths
and partially allay the great hunger that was swiftly
weakening them. They could not judge the passage
of time rationally now, and when Dick awakened
from a stupor that had come upon him in spite of all
he could do, he found the water around them almost
as smooth as glass.</p>
<p>Staggering to his feet Dick pulled Sandy to his
feet and together they gazed on a phenomenon of the
north that was like a miracle in their eyes.</p>
<p>The open water, or lead, between the land and
the berg on which they had lodged, was frozen over,
and a level walk of thin ice bridged a way to safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we walk on it?&rdquo; Sandy asked in a hoarse,
thick voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dick replied through blue lips.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll test it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Guiding his weakened legs by force of will alone,
Dick cautiously approached the edge of the floe and
placed one foot down on the ice. He bore his weight,
by degrees, on the one foot. The ice cracked a little
and gave downward, then as he placed the last of his
weight upon the ice, it broke through. Dick saved
himself from a cold bath that might, at that time,
have meant the finish of him, by falling face downward
on the floe and drawing himself back to safety.
He would have given up then, had not a heart-rending
groan from Sandy aroused in him a new determination.
For he could not bear to see his chum
lying there, slowly freezing, when there was an ounce
of strength left in him.</p>
<p>Into Dick&rsquo;s numb senses crept an idea. The snowshoes
strapped upon their backs! If the ice would
not hold weight upon the narrow surface of a boot
sole, might it not support them if their weight were
distributed upon the broad rim of snowshoes?</p>
<p>In frantic haste Dick aroused Sandy and shouted
his plan into his dazed chum&rsquo;s ears. Fumbling fingers
then began the slow process of attaching snowshoes
to tingling feet. At last the task was accomplished,
and the boys began shuffling toward the thin ice.</p>
<p>Dick went first, skating as lightly as possible out
on the ice. His heart was in his mouth. Would the
ice hold?</p>
<p>The ice sprang downward slightly and tiny cracks
spread out all around Dick, but the ice held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t follow my track,&rdquo; he cried to Sandy, about
to leave the floe. &ldquo;Start somewhere where the ice
hasn&rsquo;t been strained. We&rsquo;ve got to hurry. This salt
water may melt at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Sandy did as he was told and there began a more
perilous half mile of snowshoeing than the boys ever
before had experienced or ever hoped to experience
again.</p>
<p>Faster and faster they skated over the rubbery
ice, praying they would strike no weaker spot, every
nerve strained to the utmost in their fear-driven
flight.</p>
<p>Under any other circumstances the boys would
surely have fallen completely exhausted before they
finished that terrible half mile of snowshoeing. But
it was life or death, and all the reserve energy in
their strong, young bodies came to the front to carry
them through.</p>
<p>One last spurt of speed and they tumbled onto the
heaps of solid ice marking the beach and solid land.
Scarcely had they landed when the water broke
through the rapidly melting ice.</p>
<p>Sandy could not raise himself and Dick had just
enough strength left to drag himself to a standing
position. His roving eyes fell upon a flock of eider
ducks a little distance away. His stomach crying
out for food, Dick reeled toward the wild fowl,
scattering them to right and left. He found quickly
what he was looking for. Eggs!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Pawing into a nest he rolled out three eggs, and
without testing them to see whether they were fresh
or not, he cracked the shells and drank down the
life-giving nourishment. Hastily picking up two
more eggs, he stumbled back to Sandy and forced
him to suck the raw whites.</p>
<p>Both boys revived by the duck eggs, they waited
for the ducks to settle back to their nests, and shot
two of them.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy ordinarily would have been repelled
at the idea of eating raw flesh, but now nothing
seemed sweeter than the warm white meat of
the eider ducks. They ate their fill, like young savages,
and found warmth and strength returning to
their half-frozen bodies.</p>
<p>Spirits rising through the effect of the food and
their recent deliverance from the drifting ice floe,
the boys were about to start further inland, when
Sandy pointed to a boulder only a hundred feet
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw something move over there,&rdquo;
he whispered.</p>
<p>Dick opened his mouth to speak, but no words
came out. From behind the boulder arose the head
and upper body of an Eskimo&mdash;and yet, was it an
Eskimo?</p>
<p>&ldquo;His skin is white!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the white Eskimo!&rdquo; Dick echoed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">THE CAMP OF FROZEN MEN</span></h2>
<p>So amazed were Dick and Sandy by this sudden
and inexplicable reappearance of the white Eskimo
that they could not move from their tracks for fully
a minute. The half-breed did not move. He stared
at them as if he, too, had been surprised, then one
of his arms raised in a sort of signal.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy aroused to their danger too late.
From a dozen hiding places as many uncouth brown
figures appeared, with spears and rifles leveled at
them. Hemmed in and outnumbered, there was but
one thing for them to do&mdash;surrender.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s rifle clattered to the ice, and Dick&rsquo;s followed
quickly, while both raised their hands. The
white Eskimo then came forward and picked up
their rifles. He addressed them in broken English,
which had a French accent mingled with the Eskimo
tang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ees pleased ver&rsquo; much, boys. While zee poleece
chase zee wild goose, I git zere little helpers. Zat
not so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may have the drop on us now,&rdquo; retorted
Dick with more spirit than was really in his half-famished,
half-frozen body, &ldquo;but we have friends
nearby and you will wish you never had troubled
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white Eskimo laughed scoffingly. &ldquo;You think
you make zee fool of me. Ha! Zose mounted police
long way from here. They look, look everywhere
for Fred Mistak, but Mistak like the ghost. He
disappear like nossing&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick remained silent at this, thinking it best not
to arouse the ill-humor of their savage captor. He
was interested, if disappointed to learn that their
friends, the policemen, were so far away. He had
half-hoped the storm had thrown them back upon
land somewhere near the other members of the expedition.</p>
<p>Mistak seemed to have no desire to loiter in the
vicinity of the capture and speedily forced the boys
to fall in line and start off inland. Tired as they
were, the two prisoners assumed a calmness they did
not feel as they began the long climb up a steep
trail that led to the summit of the cliffs which
formed that portion of the coast.</p>
<p>Dick studied the evil faces of his captors and saw
that only few of them were Eskimos. The greater
number of the gang included renegade Indians, half-breeds,
and one who seemed a full blooded white
man. Dick did not doubt that every man of them
either carried a price on his head or was at least a
fugitive from the courts of justice. The white man
and two of the Indians had rifles, and Mistak wore
a revolver on a belt about his waist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The sinister company climbed to the top of the
cliffs, forcing the boys along at the point of spears,
and marched on for about a mile across the snow
and ice to what seemed to be a temporary encampment.
Six igloos had been built in the shelter of a
ridge, and two sledges loaded with frozen seal blubber
lay under the watch of an Eskimo.</p>
<p>Mistak gruffly ordered Dick and Sandy into an
igloo. As soon as the boys had reached the crude
bedding inside the snow house, they gave over to
the great weariness that possessed them. Lost to
everything but the need of sleep, they fell into a
deep unconsciousness regardless of the fact that they
were in the hands of enemies from whom they might
expect no mercy.</p>
<p>Dick knew not how long he had slept when he
aroused to hear someone at the entrance of the
igloo. One of the Eskimos crawled half way in with
two chunks of seal blubber in his arms. These he
tossed at the two recumbent forms with a few guttural
and unintelligible words in his native tongue,
and crawled out again.</p>
<p>Dick was terribly hungry, and though the seal
blubber did not exactly appeal to his appetite, he
found, upon tasting the greasy meat, that it was
better than nothing. He awakened Sandy, and together
they made their first meal upon raw seal
blubber, finding that the more they ate of it the
better it tasted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad when a fellow&rsquo;s half starved,&rdquo; Sandy
remarked as they finished the last of the blubber.</p>
<p>Dick was about to answer when the sound of
voices outside interrupted him. He signaled Sandy
to remain quiet and together they listened. But they
could not distinguish the words through the thick
walls of the igloo, though they recognized the voice
of Fred Mistak.</p>
<p>Hoping to learn something of what Mistak intended
to do with Sandy and him, Dick motioned
to his chum to remain where he was and crawled
in the hole that served as the entrance of the igloo.
A huge cake of snow had been carelessly pushed up
against the outside of the hole and placing one ear
against this, Dick could hear Mistak&rsquo;s voice quite
plainly. He seemed to be speaking to the white man
in the outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you zat we cannot bozzer wis zee two
young ones. It ees best we put them where zay
cannot talk. You see?&rdquo; Mistak was saying.</p>
<p>The other man swore, then replied loudly: &ldquo;You
know we got enough blood on our hands now, Mistak,
to send us over the road for life. It&rsquo;ll be hangin&rsquo;
for you an&rsquo; me if we put these yonkers out of
the way right under the noses of the mounted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, zen, what you say we put zem wiz Thalman?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Thalman! That was the name of the lost corporal!
Dick electrified with eagerness to hear
more, but the two walked off a little way out of earshot.
He crawled back to Sandy, confiding what he
had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to that, Corporal Thalman must be
alive alright,&rdquo; Sandy observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the question is, do we want to go where
he is as Mistak hinted. It looks like Thalman is in
a pretty tight prison or he&rsquo;d have gotten out by
this time. And we can help him more on the outside
than on the inside. Besides I don&rsquo;t trust this Mistak
a little bit. He&rsquo;d cut our throats in a minute if the
white man agreed. We&rsquo;d better see if we can&rsquo;t
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was any darkness to do it in, we might
get away,&rdquo; Sandy retorted, &ldquo;but in this never-ending
daylight, I don&rsquo;t see how we can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen&mdash;I&rsquo;ve a plan,&rdquo; Dick drew closer to his
chum, and began in a whisper. &ldquo;When we came up
I could see that this igloo was built on a long snowdrift
that stretches clear to a ravine on the right.
We still have our knives and with these we can dig a
tunnel under the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose they come in while we&rsquo;re working?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that. We&rsquo;ll work one at a time,
while one keeps watch at the entrance of the igloo.
At first we can jump up out of the tunnel, which
we&rsquo;ll start in the floor, and lie down over it with
our bedding. If they come clear inside they&rsquo;ll think
we&rsquo;re sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;What about the loose snow?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we can scatter over the floor and pack it
down with our boots. The hardest job will be coming
out of the drift at the right place. What we
must do is tunnel under the igloo and through the
drift to the side hidden from the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy became enthusiastic over Dick&rsquo;s daring
scheme and without delay they commenced the difficult
task. Dick started the digging while Sandy
watched. The snow was hard, but by keeping at it
he soon was far enough down so that he could
change the direction of his digging toward the outside
of the snowdrift, which was to furnish the
cover for their escape.</p>
<p>They had changed places twice and Sandy was
again on watch when the crunch of footfalls sounded
approaching the igloo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick. Someone&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; Sandy whispered
down the tunnel.</p>
<p>Dick was only a few seconds backing out of the
hole and dropping prone over it, the bedding drawn
about him. Sandy also feigned sleep nearby and
with bated breath they awaited whoever was coming.</p>
<p>But the Indian who looked in at the igloo entrance
did not come in. He seemed satisfied that the two
prisoners were asleep and departed to other business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>However, the narrow escape from detection put
a scare into them that set them to devising some
other means of covering up their work when visited
by one of the gang. With chunks of snow from the
tunnel they fashioned a form to resemble a body
and wrapping this in bedding they placed it in as
life-like a sleeping position as possible near the
tunnel. If they were visited again the one on watch
could lie down over the entrance to the tunnel, while
the other could lie still under the snow without leaving
the tunnel.</p>
<p>After this ruse was ready for use they felt more
confident of success and redoubled their efforts.</p>
<p>It was Dick who first poked a hole through the
snow to the light of the outside world. His heart
leaping at the thought that they had succeeded, he
looked out of the hole, only to receive one of the
greatest shocks of his life. Not ten feet away sat
an Eskimo, one of Mistak&rsquo;s band, chewing on a
chunk of seal blubber! As Dick watched with terror-widened
eyes, the Eskimo looked directly at him,
and paused in his eating. Dick could not force himself
to move. Every moment he expected some sign
from the Eskimo that he had discovered the attempt
to escape, yet the native finally resumed his eating
without any alarming actions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Breathing a sigh of relief Dick plugged up the
hole and lay on his stomach in the snow tunnel,
wondering if there had been some mistake in their
calculations which had brought them out on the
wrong side of the snowdrift. But no, they were
on the right side of the drift. Nothing could have
so confused them as to cause any such disastrous
error. The Eskimo must have been there by chance.
Dick decided that the native had been hiding from
the rest of his band, probably because he had stolen
more rations of food than was his allotment.</p>
<p>After waiting a reasonable length of time, Dick
cleared the peep hole and looked out. The Eskimo
was gone.</p>
<p>Hastily Dick wriggled back through the tunnel
and reported to Sandy the welcome news that they
had reached the surface of the drift and could now
leave the igloo.</p>
<p>Hoping they might delay the discovery of their
escape until they had a good start, they fashioned a
second dummy from rolled bedding and Sandy, the
last one into the snow tunnel, drew this over the
hole after him.</p>
<p>A few minutes later they had cautiously broken
out of the snowdrift and were crawling along the
snow bank away from the encampment.</p>
<p>Once in the ravine, into which the drift led, they
strapped on their snowshoes, which Mistak had not
thought it necessary to take from them, and made
good time away from their captors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just give us as much as an hour&rsquo;s start and I&rsquo;ll
bet they&rsquo;ll never catch us,&rdquo; Dick cried exultantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you bet they&rsquo;ll never catch me,&rdquo; Sandy repeated
emphatically. &ldquo;I think too much of my skin
to have it punched full of holes by that gun in
Mistak&rsquo;s belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Settling into a long, swinging, crab-like stride,
the boys covered almost four miles on their snowshoes
before they felt it necessary to call a halt.</p>
<p>Sandy was about winded, and fell back against
a boulder completely relaxed, but Dick still felt fairly
spry so he crawled to the top of a nearby hill and
looked over the back trail. He was about to call
down to Sandy that all was well when, from a narrow
defile through which he remembered they had
passed, he saw five figures coming fast on snowshoes.
Dick felt a chill that was not from the frosty
air creep up his spine. He did not doubt that the
distant men were Mistak and several of his gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, they&rsquo;re after us,&rdquo; Dick called down in a
tense voice.</p>
<p>Sandy got excitedly to his feet and urged Dick to
hurry on with him. But the elder lad had something
else in mind as he climbed down from the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, there are expert snowshoers in that bunch
following us,&rdquo; Dick said coolly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t stand a
show of keeping the lead we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t stand them off without rifles. All
we have left is our hunting knives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can still throw them off our track if we
use our heads,&rdquo; said Dick quickly. &ldquo;Did you notice
that long stretch of hard ice and barren rock that
we&rsquo;ve been following for more than half a mile?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sandy began to be interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can go on along the snow until we angle
into the ice and rock under that high barren hill in
front of us. They&rsquo;ll think we climbed the hill, and
will go on to pick up our tracks in the next patch
of snow. There&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll fool them. We&rsquo;ll
double on our trail where we can&rsquo;t leave any footprints,
and hide somewhere until they give up hunting
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds pretty good to me,&rdquo; replied Sandy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
mush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly, then, the boys carried their plan into
execution. They ran on to the point where the snow
gave way to barren rock and ice, swept clean by
high winds. Here they removed their snowshoes
and turned almost squarely about. Running lightly
across the stones and ice, they covered about a quarter
of a mile on the back trail leaving no tracks to
show where they had gone. Then they began looking
for a hiding place.</p>
<p>It was Dick who spied a hole under the shelf
of a cut bank, which led back under ground. There
were no signs that the cavern had been inhabited
recently by any wild animals, and after calling Sandy
to his side, Dick got on hands and knees and crawled
into the dark passage.</p>
<p>The hole grew larger as the boys traversed it, and
finally they were able to run along at a crouch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Presently Dick stopped Sandy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better not
go too far,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;Why not go back to
a point where the hole is smaller and block it up
with stones and ice? Then if they happen to discover
the entrance to this cave they&rsquo;ll run into where we&rsquo;ve
plugged it up and they&rsquo;ll think that is the end of the
cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy agreed that this was an excellent idea and
they hurried back to carry it out. Ten minutes later,
feeling much more secure with the barrier thrown
up in the small end of the passage, the boys decided
to follow the underground corridor to its end or to
a point where it branched off into a larger cave.</p>
<p>As they advanced, the passage rapidly grew
lighter, until finally they came out into broad daylight.
Looking around, they saw they had reached a
sort of amphitheater formed by walls of ice-covered
stone about fifty feet in height. The floor of the
place was about a hundred feet in diameter, but what
set the hearts of the boys to pounding frantically,
was the fact that a man sat with his back to the
wall not fifteen yards away, and a little further on,
lying with his face against the side of a broken dog
sledge, was another man.</p>
<p>Were they friend or foe? The boys did not
know. Something in the very stillness of the two
figures boded no good. But they were between two
fires, and they must take a chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, there,&rdquo; called Dick, boldly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>There was no answer. Again Dick called out,
without getting any reply. His face paled a little at
the strange silence of the men and summoning all
his courage he stepped up and grasped the one sitting
against the wall by the shoulder. With a cry of
horror he staggered back. The body was immovable
as stone to the touch, and from the depths of the
parka stared a pair of glassy, sightless eyes.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy turned and looked at each other,
swallowing lumps in their throats, and experiencing
unpleasant goose-flesh.</p>
<p>For what they had stumbled upon, in that secluded
nook, was a camp of frozen men!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">TRAPPED!</span></h2>
<p>At the moment Dick and Sandy discovered themselves
in the company of men from whom life had
long since fled, they would have gladly chosen to
face Mistak and his men rather than remain in the
strange, canyon-like pit a second longer. But time
and the real peril awaiting them, if they were discovered
by Mistak, steadied their nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly of us to act like a couple of babies when
we see two dead men,&rdquo; Dick found his tongue again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is,&rdquo; Sandy rejoined in a shaky voice,
&ldquo;but it was worse than finding a skeleton in a dark
clothes closet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick silently agreed with Sandy, but thought it
better not to admit it aloud. Instead, he assumed a
calmness he did not feel in order to disperse Sandy&rsquo;s
fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we must do now,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;is try to
find out who these men were. They may have
been of some importance in the south&mdash;engineers,
explorers, or scientists.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead if you want to,&rdquo; Sandy shook his head
as he eyed their gruesome find. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back into the
cave where I can hear any one that may come in on
the other side of the barricade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Left alone with the dead men, Dick set immediately
about what he thought was his duty. Upon
closer inspection he found that the men had not really
frozen to death as he had at first supposed, but that
one, or both, of them had died from injuries received
from a bad fall.</p>
<p>The body near the sledge was partially wedged
under one of the runners. The sledge itself was
crushed and splintered in front beyond repair. Dick
gazed up at the edge of the walls forming the amphitheater,
picturing in his mind what he thought
had happened. This is what he imagined:</p>
<p>Two men, sledging over an uncharted land in the
teeth of a blinding blizzard. An ineffectual struggle
of dog and man to avoid slipping into an abyss
which they sensed. Then the crash of the sledge and
bodies at the foot of the bank. One man had died
immediately, crushed by the fall and the sledge. The
other had lived to crawl away and lean up against
the rock wall which he had never quitted. It was
one of the countless tragedies of the north, one of
the secrets of the mysterious disappearance of men
who had braved the Arctic and never returned.</p>
<p>Dick inspected every foot of ground near the
sledge and found the remains of their dogs. But
nowhere could he find any record or memoranda as
to who the men were and what had been their mission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>He was about to examine the ice-crusted dunnage
in the wrecked sledge when Sandy came running in
calling to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s in the cave! I believe Mistak has
trailed us after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick hastily quitted his work at the sledge and
ran back into the cave after Sandy. When they
reached the point where they had plugged up the
passage, their worst fears were realized. Someone
was trying to break in, and the mumble of voices
came faintly to their ears. The boys had underestimated
the trail-craft of the white Eskimo and his
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistak has discovered our hiding place in spite
of all the pains we took to cover our tracks,&rdquo; Dick
spoke disappointedly. &ldquo;All we can do now is keep
them out by adding to this barricade. We can rebuild
it faster than they can break it down, because
on the other side only one can work at a time. Let&rsquo;s
get to work, Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>All the loose boulders and fragments of ice the
boys could find they brought to the barricade and
piled there as fast as possible. But they soon found
that their enemies were gaining on them. This was
not noticeable until the boys had used up all the
boulders near them and were required to run all the
way to the amphitheater for more material. Also,
as Mistak&rsquo;s men worked their way further in, the
cave became larger and the outlaws could work more
freely. Added to this, Dick&rsquo;s and Sandy&rsquo;s job of
filling the passage became bigger and bigger the further
back they retreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never keep them out!&rdquo; Sandy panted at
last. &ldquo;I guess this is our last adventure, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up yet, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick strove to encourage
his chum.</p>
<p>Grimly, they stuck to the losing fight, determined
not to give up until they had carried the last available
stone into the passage to impede the progress
of Fred Mistak, whose voice they could now plainly
hear urging his men on to greater efforts. Like rats
excavated by a clawing dog, Dick and Sandy were
determined to sell their lives dearly.</p>
<p>Yet, Providence intervened. Suddenly, the work
of Mistak&rsquo;s men ceased, and the echo of running
feet sounded in the icy corridor, accompanied by
hoarse shouts of anger and dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; Sandy turned to Dick, hardly
able to believe the good fortune that seemed to be
coming to them.</p>
<p>Dick did not answer, but stood very still, listening
intently. Finally, the last sounds of retreating footsteps
died away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait a little longer, then open up the
passage and find out what or who frightened Mistak
away,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>For what seemed to the boys about a quarter
of an hour, they waited in the dark passage. At the
end of this time they began cautiously removing the
boulders that blocked the passage. A few minutes
later they crawled one at a time from the tiny entrance,
finding the vicinity deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; Dick looked about puzzledly. &ldquo;What do
you suppose frightened them away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was as much at loss as his chum to account
for Mistak&rsquo;s departure, but presently a distant
hail electrified them with attention, and the mystery
of their rescue was solved.</p>
<p>About three hundred yards across the snow appeared
a dog team and two men, the identity of
whom the boys were not long in correctly guessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! The police! The police!&rdquo; shouted Dick,
leaping down the rocky slope joyously, Sandy close
on his heels.</p>
<p>It was not long before Dick and Sandy were
eagerly gripping the huge, mittened hands of Corporal
McCarthy and Constable Sloan. The story of
their adventures since the officers had left the base,
bubbled from their lips by fits and starts, the policemen
hardly succeeding in getting a word in edgewise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mistak pulled up stakes and mushed on when we
made it too hot for him on the glacier,&rdquo; Corporal
McCarthy finally managed to explain. &ldquo;We picked
up his trail again three days ago and have been
traveling fast ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, his camp can&rsquo;t be more than five miles
from here,&rdquo; Dick hastened to say. &ldquo;But Mistak
won&rsquo;t stay there now, Corporal. He&rsquo;s a mighty
clever criminal, and now he knows you&rsquo;re this close
he&rsquo;ll work a trick to get you off the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t let him get away if there&rsquo;s half
a chance nabbing him,&rdquo; Corporal McCarthy replied
determinedly. &ldquo;But Sloan and I need a few hours&rsquo;
rest, and we might as well look over those bodies
you boys say you found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dogs were unharnessed outside the cavern
entrance, and left in charge of Constable Sloan,
while Corporal McCarthy crawled into the cave after
Dick and Sandy. The officer was as amazed as the
boys had been when he first laid eyes upon the
frozen figures. His opinion was that of Dick&mdash;that
the men had slid or stepped over the precipitous
wall of the amphitheater while blinded by a snow
storm. Though the policeman searched fully an hour
for something by which to identify the bodies, he
had no luck, and at last gave up after making a brief
entry in a small notebook he carried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;The best we can do is give them an Eskimo
burial,&rdquo; the Corporal concluded his inspection. &ldquo;If
you fellows will help me gather a few stones we&rsquo;ll
soon have the sad business over with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, as gently as possible, they
deposited the bodies in their last resting place, and
built over each a substantial cairn of stones.</p>
<p>From the wrecked sledge, Corporal McCarthy
then tore some strips of wood, and lashing two together
with leather thongs, he fashioned a cross for
each. On the horizontal cross-pieces he carved this
inscription:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Found Sept. 19, 1925.
<br />Identity Unknown.
<br />Corporal Lake McCarthy, R.N.W.M.P.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the crosses were planted and they had
bowed their heads in silent prayer for the unknown
victims of the north, they quitted the cavern and rejoined
Constable Sloan.</p>
<p>A temporary camp was made, tea boiled, and bedding
spread out, and while the boys thirstily gulped
the hot beverage, the policemen discussed plans for
the apprehension of Fred Mistak.</p>
<p>Among many other things the boys learned that
they were upward of forty miles from the base of
supplies Toma had been left alone to guard. The
island upon which they thought they had landed
when they left the mainland, seemed to stretch endlessly
to the northeast, widening constantly until it
disappeared under a solid ice cap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Fuel oil for the special camp stoves was very
low, and the policemen had only about three days&rsquo;
provisions left, which was largely fresh musk-ox
which Constable Sloan had shot during the man
hunt. Also several of the dogs had died from
piblockto, a sort of madness peculiar to the polar
regions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to what the policemen say,&rdquo; Dick
confided to Sandy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to make quick work
of Mistak. With the supplies as low as they say they
are, we&rsquo;ll have to start for our base mighty soon or
the north will do for us what it did for those two
fellows at the end of the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get back any too soon to suit me,&rdquo;
said Sandy earnestly.</p>
<p>The policemen rested the dogs and themselves for
nearly two hours, when they harnessed up and once
more set out upon the trail of Fred Mistak. Half a
mile from the white Eskimo&rsquo;s rendezvous the snowshoe
tracks led on steadily, then there were signs of
a delay in the trampled snow. One man had gone
on from there, obviously to warn whoever had been
left at the igloos of the proximity of the police.
Beside the undeviating snowshoe prints leading toward
Mistak&rsquo;s igloos, there was a bewildering maze
of tracks leading in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve scattered out, every man for himself,&rdquo;
was Constable Sloan&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;But if we hurry
on to the camp we might catch a few of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Corporal McCarthy thought this good counsel, and
they set out immediately for the encampment from
which Dick and Sandy had so recently escaped. But
they found the igloos deserted, their round, white
domes crushed and destroyed.</p>
<p>Constable Sloan explained to the boys that the
igloos had been broken down by the superstitious
Eskimos in Mistak&rsquo;s band, who believed that if they
left the igloos intact, evil spirits would come and
live in them.</p>
<p>The policemen were considerably disappointed to
find that Mistak&rsquo;s band had once more given them
the slip. The scattering of the band had made it impossible
to tell just which trail was Mistak&rsquo;s, and
there was nothing more to do but return to the base
of operations for more dogs and supplies.</p>
<p>After a scanty meal at Mistak&rsquo;s deserted camp,
they set out upon the forty-mile dash to the home
camp, praying for fair weather, and hoping no more
of the dogs would contract the dreaded piblockto.</p>
<p>Five days of fair weather and the half-famished
company came in sight of their base to find considerable
changes in evidence. In place of the three
igloos they had built, there were ten of the neat
snow houses. A host of dogs hung about the little
village, and out at sea they could see two kayacks
bobbing about, manned by as many Eskimos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this!&rdquo; exclaimed Corporal McCarthy.
&ldquo;Visitors, eh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I know how they came here!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know, too,&rdquo; Sandy added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think accounts for all these
uninvited guests?&rdquo; asked Constable Sloan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sipsa brought them,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;Remember,
I told you how he left us and that his trail led over
the back trail? Well, just as Sandy and I had it
figured out, he went after some of his people on account
of the good seal hunting here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the appearance of Toma changed the
subject, and the boys hastened forward to greet their
young Indian friend. Though Toma must have been
filled with great joy upon seeing Dick and Sandy
safe and sound, he did not express it except with a
broad grin and an added brightness in his black eyes.</p>
<p>Shortly, proof appeared that Dick had been right
in his surmise as to the reason for the coming of the
Eskimos. It was in the form of Sipsa&rsquo;s moon face,
split by a huge smile. The guide showed himself
while Toma and the policemen were unharnessing
the dogs and unpacking the sledge. Constable Sloan
spoke to the native, reprimanding him for deserting
the boys, but Sipsa did not quite understand that his
offense had been so serious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sipsa says the hunting was good here, and he
could not resist carrying the news to his people,&rdquo;
Constable Sloan interpreted. &ldquo;He adds that he had
trouble in convincing them that the glacier was not
haunted by bad spirits. The drivers who deserted us
carried the news back to the village that the &lsquo;white
Eskimo&rsquo; had changed all of us to ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take an evil spirit to do that in this
country,&rdquo; Dick remarked to Sandy, recalling the
frozen bodies they had found so recently.</p>
<p>Having eaten their fill and had a few hours&rsquo; nap,
Dick and Sandy crawled out of their igloo and commenced
a detailed inspection of their native visitors.
While most of the men and women were out hunting,
a few old women and children had remained
behind.</p>
<p>The old women were making boots and shirts of
sealskin and caribou hide, using an ivory needle and
thread of caribou sinews. They did not seem to
mind having Dick and Sandy watch them, and so
the boys satisfied their curiosity to the utmost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>At one of the igloos a woman was cleaning a fur
rug or robe by an interesting method. She poured
melted snow water upon the fur, and shook it in the
cold air until the tiny drops of moisture clinging to
the hairs froze into globules of ice. It seemed that
the particles of dirt in the fur were imprisoned in
the little balls of ice. When the fur seemed well
covered with the ice crust, the women lay it fur-side
down in clean snow and beat it for a long time.
This done, she hung up the robe and beat the fur
side, the ice particles flying to right and left. When
the last of the ice balls had disappeared from the fur,
the robe seemed as dry and glossy as if it still was
on the animal that first had borne it.</p>
<p>The boys were called away from the Eskimos by
Corporal McCarthy who wished them to explain to
him again just what they had heard regarding Corporal
Thalman, the lost officer, while they were
prisoners at Mistak&rsquo;s rendezvous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">A NARWHAL</span></h2>
<p>Certain, now, through the chance discoveries of
Dick and Sandy, that Corporal Thalman was alive
somewhere in the frozen land, the policemen hastened
to prepare for another venture into Mistak&rsquo;s
outlaw fastnesses. The nearness of the polar winter,
or period of complete darkness, also served to hasten
them in their work, for without the sun to light the
trail and under the terrible cold that accompanied
the long night, they could not hope to accomplish
anything.</p>
<p>Two days after pulling into their base of supplies
from their first long and unsuccessful man
hunt, the policemen once more set out in the direction
they had lost Mistak, leaving Dick and Sandy
with plenty of good advice and many precautions
for them to avoid the dangers which they had fallen
into when first left to take care of themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Dick and Sandy put in the first twelve hours following
the departure of the officers, in cleaning and
oiling extra rifles from the supplies, to replace those
taken by Mistak, and in practicing with a harpoon.
Sipsa proved a willing teacher in the art of handling
this death dealing weapon effectively, and while the
boys could not begin to equal the accuracy of the
life-time trained natives, they were attentive students
and soon became fair marksmen.</p>
<p>After nearly a week of practice with the harpoon
the boys decided to commandeer a kayack each and
try their luck at sea, along with the Eskimo hunters.
Sipsa had begun to pick up some English words, and
the boys had managed to master a little Eskimo, so
that when the day came for their first try at hunting
with a harpoon, there was more of an understanding
between them and their Eskimo friend than there
had been formerly.</p>
<p>A narwhal had been sighted several times in the
vicinity of the seal herd, Sipsa said, and the boys
took added interest in the hunt with the promise of
such big game as a whale to lead them on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I get my harpoon into that narwhal before
you do,&rdquo; sang out Sandy, as they put off shore
in the waterproofed kayacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you do, it may be my lucky day,&rdquo; Dick
came back. &ldquo;Those narwhals are mean fellows and
if you don&rsquo;t get them in a vital spot they can smash
your kayack with their tail or long spear tusk and
drown you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance on that,&rdquo; Sandy replied, not
quite so enthusiastically as he deftly guided his craft
toward the hunters at work in the seal herd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>But the boys did not join in the seal hunt. For
a time they amused themselves by running races in
the kayacks which handled a good deal like canoes.
Gradually they drifted further out to sea and away
from the Eskimos, busily dodging icebergs and casting
and recasting their harpoons into the water to
accustom themselves to throwing from a rocking
kayack.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile from the seal herd
Dick paused to rest and to permit Sandy, whom he
had outdistanced, to overtake him. The sea seemed
to him particularly clear of floating ice at this point,
he having noticed but one small fragment of ice
about twenty feet ahead of him.</p>
<p>For probably a minute Dick watched Sandy paddling
forward, and then he faced the front again
only to receive a distinct shock. The low-lying berg
had moved by some power other than the ocean current.
Eyes widened, Dick watched what he had
thought to be an inanimate piece of ice. His heart
hammered against his breast. Again the ice moved,
and this time it surged upward, the water seething
and foaming about it. One glimpse Dick got of a
white belly, a long pointed snout, and a huge slashing
tail, and then the whole vision vanished in a
whirl of waves that rocked his frail craft crazily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Dick knew now that what he had thought to be
a fragment of mottled ice, was the narwhal Sipsa
had told them was haunting the vicinity. His hand
tightened on his harpoon as he turned to shout the
news of his discovery to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The narwhal! The narwhal!&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>
<p>Sandy redoubled his efforts at the thrilling words,
but Dick suddenly had other business to attract his
attention. For the narwhal had again come to the
surface near his canoe.</p>
<p>Holding his breath until the great mammal turned
broadside to him, Dick waited heedless of Sandy&rsquo;s
repeated cries for him to wait until he had joined
him. The right moment came as the huge, grayish
body rolled with the waves. Dick cast with all the
strength of his right arm. The harpoon darted
across the water with a hiss, the coil of thong attaching
it securely to the kayack paying out after it.
The cast had not missed. Not far back of the head
the heavy harpoon imbedded itself in the narwhal
and with a swiftness surprising in so cumbersome
an animal, the great body went into action.</p>
<p>The harpoon line had been tied securely to the
kayack and as the narwhal lunged forward, the stout
thong tightened with a snap. Dick and the kayack
shot completely out of the water, and when the boat
landed it was traveling at the rate of about thirty
miles an hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Grim and white-faced, Dick hung on. He could
have severed the harpoon line with a stroke of his
keen hunting knife, yet this he did not intend to do
while the kayack still remained afloat.</p>
<p>Spray flying in all directions, the narwhal headed
due northeast, toward the open sea. Had it not been
for the submarine-like build of the kayack and the
waterproofed jacket enclosing its passenger, the
craft might have sunk in the first hundred yards of
that swift dash. As it was, Dick experienced a sensation
much like that felt by a bather riding a surfboard
which is being towed by a gasoline speed-boat.</p>
<p>Every minute during the breath-taking ride behind
the harpooned narwhal, Dick hoped the monster
might either weaken from his wound, or change his
course and swim to a point where Sandy or the
Eskimo hunters might lend a hand in finishing the
battle with their harpoons. If the narwhal took a
notion to dive, Dick knew all was lost, and his only
means of saving himself that of quickly severing
the harpoon line.</p>
<p>Dick had almost lost hope and was about ready
to cut the line, when the narwhal changed his course
suddenly. The line slackened as the huge gray and
black body propelling the kayack swerved in a
shower of spray, and doubled on its course. The
kayack shot on by its own momentum, until with
a powerful jerk the line hauled it about. The sudden
turn tipped the kayack over as if it had been a
feather, then the same force righted it again, while
Dick blew the water out of his mouth and nose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Maddened by his wound, the narwhal seemed not
to know or care where it went. Like a mighty propeller
his fan-like tail lashed the water to a frenzy,
as it headed straight toward Sandy&rsquo;s bobbing kayack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him have your harpoon as he goes by,&rdquo; Dick
screamed to Sandy through a cupped palm.</p>
<p>Sandy shook his harpoon in the air in reply, and
Dick could see him settle for a cast as he rushed on.</p>
<p>At first the narwhal seemed to be headed at an
angle that would bring him past Sandy&rsquo;s kayack
across the prow at a distance of about ten yards,
close enough for a good cast with the harpoon. But,
less than a hundred yards from Sandy&rsquo;s kayack, the
big mammal changed course slightly, and with a
hoarse shout of dismay, Dick saw that if the narwhal
kept on he would ram Sandy&rsquo;s kayack squarely
in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of the way!&rdquo; shouted Dick frantically.</p>
<p>But Sandy was already making all haste with his
paddle, and so well did he handle his kayack that
the rushing sea-giant failed to run him down by
several inches. As the big body whizzed by, Sandy
made a quick throw with his harpoon, but missed,
his line dropping over Dick&rsquo;s taut one, narrowly
escaping entanglement as Dick&rsquo;s kayack collided with
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on, Dick!&rdquo; Sandy shouted as his chum
shot past him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re headed straight toward
Sipsa and the other hunters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had already foreseen this and his hopes were
rising when, without any warning whatsoever, the
narwhal dived. Had he gone far down Dick would,
no doubt, have been dragged under water and
drowned before he could slash free the harpoon line.
As it was, the narwhal dived up and down alternately,
drawing the prow of the kayack under water
with a rush and bringing it up again with giddy
speed.</p>
<p>Choking and gasping as the icy water trickled
into his parka above the waterproof covering on the
kayack, Dick had almost given up hope while blindly
slashing at the harpoon line, when the narwhal ceased
diving and began darting this way and that over
the surface of the water. Desisting in his attempts
to sever the line, Dick saw that the Eskimo hunters
were paddling fast toward him and that they would
soon reach a point where their harpoons could finish
the narwhal.</p>
<p>Completely maddened by the pain of his wound,
and the constant drag of the kayack, the narwhal
seemed to have lost all fear of man, for when his
short-sighted eyes caught sight of the Eskimo
hunters he made straight toward them, his great
mouth wide open and revealing a frightful toothless
cavern under the long sword-like tusk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>But the hunters did not give way save to give
the narwhal room to pass between them. Seven
harpoons impaled the narwhal as he dashed in
among the kayacks, and his speed was lessened by
half. Soon the monster was floundering about in a
welter of blood, growing weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>As soon as the Eskimos had the situation well in
hand, Dick cut away his harpoon line and made all
haste to paddle to shore. The icy water that had
splashed into his shirt through his hood was already
numbing him with cold. Before he got to shore
his nose lost all sense of feeling, then suffered a burning
sensation as if it had come in contact with a hot
iron. Dick knew then that he had frozen his nose.
Beaching the kayack, he grabbed up his mittens full
of snow and buried his face in this frost absorbing
application as he ran for the igloo and an oil stove.</p>
<p>A half hour later Sandy burst through the round
door of their igloo to find his chum nursing a badly
frosted face. Dick&rsquo;s nose and cheeks were as white
as tallow and he was writhing with pain as the blood
commenced to circulate again in the frozen tissues.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, you got it bad, didn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Sandy sympathized.
&ldquo;But, say, when you see that big narwhal
laid out on the shore, you&rsquo;ll think it was worth it.
It was sure game of you to hang on to that fellow
when you could as easily as not cut loose your line.&rdquo;
Dick smiled bravely through his burning pains.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I deserve all that flattery, Sandy.
When that whale started to dive, I&rsquo;d have slashed
the rope if I could have located it. But the water
blinded me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following day Dick&rsquo;s face was well enough
for him to go out into the outside air, so long as he
kept bundled up to his eyes. He walked down to
the beach with Sandy where the narwhal had been
towed in.</p>
<p>Though not nearly so large as the common species
of whale inhabiting the seas further south, the narwhal
was fully sixteen feet long, not including the
six-foot tusk of twisted ivory that extended from
his blunt nose, and must have weighed several thousand
pounds. The Eskimos had already begun to
cut up the enormous masses of blubber and to extract
the whalebone from the jaws. Dick procured
a small piece of the bone as a keep-sake, though for
the present his frosted nose was enough to keep the
episode in his memory for several weeks to come.</p>
<p>Dick felt that his face was in no condition for him
to stay out long that day, and so after the mid-day
meal Sandy ventured out alone with his rifle to see
if he could not knock down a few eider ducks and
gather more of their eggs.</p>
<p>Sandy wandered along the sea shore in the direction
of the cairn they had erected near the meteorite.
He shot two eider ducks and located a dozen fresh
eggs in the nests, which he collected in a leather bag.
This done, he walked down to the shore ice and sat
down upon a lump, his feet hanging over the lapping
water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>He had sat there idly gazing to sea for about five
minutes when he noticed a queer object bobbing
about in the water about twenty feet from shore.
It was dark and round, attracting Sandy&rsquo;s curiosity
immediately. After considerable maneuvering he
managed to fish it out with the muzzle of his rifle.</p>
<p>What Sandy picked up in his hands was a large
canteen or thermos bottle, used on expeditions in the
polar regions. It was covered with sodden leather
and evidently had been afloat for a long period of
time.</p>
<p>Slowly turning the bottle over in his hands, Sandy
found carved in the leather this inscription:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Look Inside
<br />C. T.
<br />R.N.W.M.P.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ejaculation of amazement and of triumph
burst from Sandy&rsquo;s lips, and forgetting all about his
ducks and eggs, he set out at a run for the camp,
the canteen hugged tightly under one arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>

<br /><span class="small">THE FLOATING MANUSCRIPT</span></h2>
<p>When Sandy burst into the igloo with his precious
find clutched to his breast he found Dick
asleep. He shook his chum out of the sleeping bag
in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the excitement about?&rdquo; Dick mumbled
rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something from Corporal Thalman,&rdquo; Sandy
cried, thrusting the canteen under Dick&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Dick started forward as he read the words carved
in the leather, and uttered a cry of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s an axe? Let&rsquo;s break the bottle open and
see what&rsquo;s inside! Won&rsquo;t Corporal McCarthy open
his eyes when he sees this!&rdquo; Dick was even more
excited than Sandy.</p>
<p>A moment later they had split the bottle as carefully
as they could and from the inside extracted a
tightly rolled strip of leather, about the width of an
ordinary sheet of writing paper.</p>
<p>The leather apparently had been cut from an old
shirt. Unrolled, it presented a mass of words and a
crude map, carved in the leather by something in the
nature of a sharp stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a message from Corporal Thalman!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dick, deciphering the initials, &ldquo;C. T.&rdquo; and
the abbreviation for &ldquo;Royal Northwest Mounted
Police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that map shows where he is!&rdquo; Sandy cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now it looks the same as Greek to me,&rdquo;
Dick admitted, frowning over the wandering lines,
crosses and data. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s read the script and see if
that will help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is what the boys read from the
strange manuscript:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If Fate is kind and this bottle and message fall into friendly
hands, I desire the nearest post of the R.N.W. M.P. be notified
that the undersigned is now being unlawfully held a prisoner on
a glacial island several miles off the northern coast of Grant
Land, about half way between Cape Columbia and Cape
Richards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detailed to apprehend a half-breed Eskimo murderer, I
picked up his trail on the barrens and followed him to this
island where a band of outlaws, led by Mistak, surprised and
captured me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I calculate I have been imprisoned about six months in an
ice-sealed pit at the bottom of a glacier, which seems to have
been formed by an eruption ages ago. The pit has an outlet
above my head into one of the large fissures in the top strata
of the glacier, which I have tried to locate by means of the
accompanying map. One side of the pit is formed of ice many
feet thick. By weeks of work I cut my way through this into
a series of grottoes or caverns lined with crystallized ice. However,
I have so far been unable to find any outlet to the surface
of the glacier and the caverns are so cold that I cannot
spend much time in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pit is warmer due to what I believe to be hot springs
miles beneath me. A small underground stream of tepid, fresh
water, tasting slightly of sulphur, runs across the floor of the
pit, out of one wall into another, and upon this I shall set this
canteen afloat, hoping by some miracle of good fortune that it
will reach the sea and there be discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistak furnishes me every so often with a supply of seal
blubber which he drops down from the top of the pit. I do
not know why he keeps me alive, except out of fiendish desire
to see me suffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone attempting to locate me may do so in two ways&mdash;by
means of the fissure into which this pit opens, or from the
crystal grottoes. Since I have been unable to find an outlet to
the grottoes, that method of reaching the pit seems impractical,
and I have directed all my efforts on this map toward guiding
a rescuing party to the fissure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided Mistak does not neglect bringing me food for too
long a period, I shall be alive when this is read, though I notice
some symptoms of scurvy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now set this canteen adrift with its message, trusting in
Providence to guide it into the hands of those who will understand
the suffering and peril of my plight, and act accordingly.
<span class="jr">&ldquo;Corporal James E. Thalman,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;R.N.W.M.P.</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;August 15 (?) 1925.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Dick and Sandy finished reading the message at
about the same time, yet they did not draw from it
quite the same conclusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I found the canteen after it had been floating
and drifting for nearly two months,&rdquo; Sandy
spoke, still awed by the importance of his discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as Corporal Thalman hoped, his message
found its way to the sea from some underground
stream,&rdquo; Dick rejoined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Upon re-examining the map they satisfied themselves
that the glacial island drawn there was the
one they were now camping upon. They traced the
trail by which they had come along the east side of
the ridge, and rejoiced to find that the meteor stone
indicated by the cross must be identical with the one
they had found. Estimating on a basis of the scale
of miles drawn by Corporal Thalman, they found
they were encamped not more than five miles from
the point at which the Corporal had been captured
eight months before, and hardly thirty miles, allowing
for detours, from the actual prison pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boy! This is more thrilling than looking
for lost mines!&rdquo; Sandy cried exuberantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s even more risky,&rdquo; Dick returned, &ldquo;and in
this case it&rsquo;s just as difficult. There must be a lot
of inaccuracies in this map. The location here may
be pretty near ten miles off. I wish the policemen
were here to help. This is really too big a job for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a feather in our caps if we found
Corporal Thalman all by ourselves!&rdquo; Sandy puffed
out his chest.</p>
<p>Dick admitted that it would, though he reprimanded
Sandy for his exaggeration of their capabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we get ready to hunt for the Corporal we
must draw a copy of this map and leave it for Corporal
McCarthy,&rdquo; Dick directed. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t return
before we leave on a search for the fissure, the
copy will give them all the information they need to
work on their own accord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later the boys had completed a copy of
the map and message, detail by detail, and prepared
for a few hours rest before they started for the
glacier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<div class="img" id="p3">
<img src="images/p3.jpg" alt="Map" width="500" height="615" />
</div>
<p>The boys awakened after nearly eight hours
sleep, to find that the policemen had not yet returned.
They immediately set about harnessing a dog team
and loading a sledge with a few days&rsquo; supplies. They
intended to hunt musk-oxen also on their trip inland,
and in that way kill two birds with one stone.
Provided they failed to locate Corporal Thalman&rsquo;s
prison, they could at least bring back a sledge load
of musk-ox meat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Since Sipsa and his Eskimos could be depended
upon to take care of the camp, Dick decided that
Toma should go with them if he liked, and found
the Indian boy overjoyed at the opportunity to
escape the dullness of life at the supply base.</p>
<p>After bidding the grinning, moon-faced Sipsa
good-bye, the boys started out, driving their dog
team at a gallop. It was not long before they reached
a point below the head of the glacial ridge from
which they could see the meteor stone near which
they had built the cairn.</p>
<p>From there they began to count their strides&mdash;approximately
1,760 to a mile, and three miles to the
spot where Corporal Thalman had been attacked and
captured by Mistak and his band. Dick and Sandy
both counted their steps so they might check against
each other when the required distance was covered.</p>
<p>At last they reached a mass of boulders sticking
up out of the snow which was within a quarter
mile of the distance on the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like a likely place for a man to be
surprised and captured,&rdquo; said Dick, signaling them
to halt. He referred to the map. &ldquo;According to the
route laid out here, Mistak bore slightly to the left
when he went on with his captive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>With this in mind they passed the boulders and
came out on a broad, snow-covered tundra stretching
for several miles inland from the sea and ending
abruptly some miles south in towering walls of ice
that marked the position of the glacier.</p>
<p>Driving southwest, the three boys began the long
trek across the tundra, hoping they might soon sight
the abandoned igloos indicated on the map as the
next landmark.</p>
<p>But two hours of steady mushing failed to raise
anything resembling a habitation. The tundra still
stretched monotonously ahead of them, the countless
acres of snow glaring in their eyes as it reflected
the sun&rsquo;s rays.</p>
<p>Dick called a halt and the three boys gathered
about the sledge, permitting the dogs to lie down and
rest their tired legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to use our heads now,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;Corporal Thalman has either underestimated the
distance from the point of his capture to the igloos,
or else we&rsquo;re traveling in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; put in Sandy, &ldquo;that no Eskimo
would build an igloo out on this level plain where it
would catch the full force of all the storms that blew
down from the pole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Sandy,&rdquo; announced Dick. &ldquo;Those
igloos must have been built where there was some
sort of wind break. Suppose we swing around due
south until we get into the rough country on the
outskirts of the glacier.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to be about the best plan,&rdquo; Sandy rejoined.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch there&rsquo;s nothing north of us
as far as the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me no savvy,&rdquo; Toma muttered, and Dick promised
to explain the map more thoroughly when they
pitched camp.</p>
<p>The distance to the glacier was deceiving. It was
fully an hour after they changed their course before
they struck the first break in the tundra and began
to climb upward along the ravine down the trough
of which the glacier had flung out a finger centuries
before.</p>
<p>When they had climbed to a height nearly a hundred
feet above the tundra they paused to reconnoiter.
Approximating their position on Corporal
Thalman&rsquo;s map, they judged themselves to be in a
big bend in the formation of the glacier. Far ahead,
over the various hills and ridges, they could see
where the vast mass of ice broadened and began its
slide to the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I think,&rdquo; Dick broke a long
silence, &ldquo;those igloos are right under the walls of the
glacier where it flows down to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Sandy
replied dubiously, &ldquo;but why not go on pretty slow
so we can examine all the territory between us and
where the glacier turns?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better yet,&rdquo; Dick sanctioned. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be too
thorough. For all we know, every mistake we make
in reading this map may be just like pounding another
nail in Corporal Thalman&rsquo;s coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Sandy shivered at the thought, as they
started out again.</p>
<p>With an interval of some hundred yards between
them, the boys proceeded, Toma in the center driving
the dog team. Almost any of the sheltered spots
in the vicinity of the glacier might hide half a dozen
igloos, and they were not going to pass up any likely
places if they could help it.</p>
<p>The boys were growing weary, indeed, when
Sandy, considerably in the lead, stopped dead still
upon a mound of ice, and let out a cheer like an Indian
war whoop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are! There they are!&rdquo; his shout was
faintly borne to the ears of Dick and Toma.</p>
<p>The two forced their tired legs into a staggering
run, which soon brought them up with Sandy.</p>
<p>Below them, snug on the southern slope of a
pyramid of glacial drift, were the abandoned igloos.</p>
<p>They had located the second landmark on the trail
to Corporal Thalman&rsquo;s prison!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">MUSK OXEN</span></h2>
<p>After locating the six abandoned igloos, the boys
were too tired to go on without a rest, and they
immediately unharnessed the dogs and pitched their
tupiks or tents. They soon were gathered about a
tiny camp stove listening to the musical murmurings
of a pot of tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so far so good,&rdquo; said Dick, stretching his
legs and lying back comfortably. &ldquo;If we have no
more trouble than this tracing Corporal Thalman&rsquo;s
route the rest of the way, we can pat ourselves on
the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;d better make quick work of it,&rdquo;
Sandy rejoined. &ldquo;Do you notice how low the sun is
getting these days? Pretty soon we&rsquo;ll begin to have
twilight, and that means winter is about with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the long night,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Well, in
a way I hope we get our business done up here before
winter sets in, and in a way I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Sandy asked, puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a wonderful experience,&rdquo; Dick returned,
&ldquo;to live four months without seeing the sun,
nothing but the stars and once in a while the moon to
give any light. And not even the stars when it&rsquo;s
cloudy. They say it gets so dark during the long
night up here that you can pretty near reach out of
your igloos and bring in a handful of darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be awful,&rdquo; Sandy wagged his head
ruefully. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see what you want to endure all
that for. Think of the thermometer going down to
60 degrees below zero, and what if we ran out of
food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we could winter up here alright if we
had to do it,&rdquo; Dick returned. &ldquo;The Eskimos are
laying up tons of walrus and seal blubber. Besides,
there&rsquo;s that narwhal, and we&rsquo;re going to bag a few
musk-oxen pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me no like um blubber,&rdquo; Toma spoke up vehemently.
&ldquo;No eat um blubber all winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Sandy agreed emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you fellows would think blubber was
pretty good if there wasn&rsquo;t anything else to chew on
except sealskin boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation had grown unpleasant in this
vein, so the boys changed the subject to the map,
which Dick spread out in the snow and explained
to Toma, as he had promised. But their eyes soon
grew heavy with sleep, and after finishing their
scanty rations of frozen bear meat, they retired,
Dick standing the first watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>When each of them had had about five hours&rsquo; rest,
they ate more bear meat, drank a pot of tea and were
ready for the trail. The problem now ahead of them
was the scaling of the glacier, towering in a low
range of mountains about two miles from the abandoned
igloos. The map indicated no exact route to
the top of the glacier, except that from the abandoned
igloos there was a change of course somewhat
to the southwest.</p>
<p>They had been on the trail only half an hour
when Toma&rsquo;s keen eyes detected signs of musk-oxen.
The Indian boy showed Dick and Sandy the marks
of the hoofs in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better see if we can&rsquo;t shoot a few of the
fellows that made these tracks,&rdquo; Dick advised. &ldquo;We
can leave the meat cached in ice and covered with
stones. Then when we return we can pick it up on an
empty sledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was eager for the hunt and so the boys
swung off the course they had been following, and
began trailing the musk-oxen. The tracks were quite
fresh and they all looked at their rifles to see that
they were ready for quick shooting. Since they
never before had hunted musk-oxen, they did not
know just what to expect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>They had trailed the musk-oxen about half a mile
when, climbing out of a ravine, they came suddenly
upon them. There were five of the strange creatures
huddled in a circle, tail to tail, save for one, who
stood out from the rest facing the young hunters.
For several minutes the boys stood still before the
shaggy beasts, who seemed not to fear them in the
least. Dick was first to shake off his attack of &ldquo;buck
fever.&rdquo; Raising his rifle, he took careful aim at the
animal nearest them. He chose a vulnerable spot,
and at the crack of his rifle, the musk-ox sank to his
knees, tried ineffectually to rise, and at last rolled
over and expired.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s shot awakened Sandy and Toma from the
trance into which the first sight of the creatures had
thrown them, and each of them picked an animal
from the band, bringing them down with a shot
each. All fired again, and though the last of the
five made an awkward attempt to run away, they
brought it down together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to shoot such quiet, peaceful brutes,&rdquo;
said Sandy as they hurried up to the brownish forms
in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That meat means life for us,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;and
maybe God put them here for just that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s feeling of remorse over the shooting of
the musk-oxen soon disappeared after they reached
the fallen herd. As zoological specimens the musk-oxen
were food for thought, and when the boys had
finished examining the huge gnarled horns and the
broad, rounded backs, there was the cutting up of
the meat to be performed. So intent did they become
upon the latter task that for a time they forgot entirely
their surroundings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>It was Toma whose sharp ears first sensed that
they were not alone. He spoke a few guttural words
to Dick and Sandy in an undertone, and all three
reached for their rifles. When they turned to face
the ravine up which they had climbed just before
sighting the musk-oxen, they could hear the crunch
of snowshoes. Prepared for the worst, they brought
their rifles to their hips and cocked them.</p>
<p>A scowling, fur-bordered face appeared over the
edge of the ravine, paused a moment, then finished
the climb followed by two more unprepossessing individuals
clad in worn, soiled furs. The three paused
on the brow of the ravine, silently inspecting the
boys.</p>
<p>Dick recognized the one who was in advance of
the others as the white man he had seen in Mistak&rsquo;s
band. He was certain the other two were likewise
outlaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; called Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; pertic&rsquo;lar, yonker,&rdquo; replied the white
man. &ldquo;It just happens we&rsquo;ve been a-huntin&rsquo; these
here musk-ox you&rsquo;se has shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happens we saw them before you did,&rdquo; returned
Dick suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I guess you wuz luckier than we&rsquo;ns, but
that&rsquo;s no call f&rsquo;r us to hold a grudge against each
other,&rdquo; said the man, starting forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s far enough!&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s clear voice rang out
in the icy air, as the rifle came to his shoulder. He
was sure the three outlaws meant no good, and made
sure he had some advantage if it came to open
hostilities.</p>
<p>The white man paused and scowled. &ldquo;Think y&rsquo;r
pretty sly, eh! I guess I oughta agreed with Mistak
&rsquo;bout puttin&rsquo; you yonkers out of business while we
had the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happens I overheard you talking to Mistak
about that when you thought Sandy and I were
asleep in the igloo. You suggested we be put with
Corporal Thalman,&rdquo; Dick replied sternly.</p>
<p>The white man started visibly. &ldquo;Thalman!&rdquo; his
voice came hoarsely from his bearded lips. &ldquo;What
do you yonkers know &rsquo;bout Thalman?&rdquo; There was
plain menace in the man&rsquo;s attitude now.</p>
<p>Dick was almost on the point of blurting out some
valuable information, when he caught himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he answered reservedly, &ldquo;only the
Mounted Police are looking for&mdash;er&mdash;his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;ll find, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s pretty
doubtful if they find that,&rdquo; sneered Mistak&rsquo;s man,
seeming relieved that the boys apparently had no
specific knowledge of Corporal Thalman&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>Had the man dreamed of the manuscript that had
floated into Sandy&rsquo;s hands, of the map now reposing
in Dick&rsquo;s pocket, he probably would have signaled
his companions to attack then and there. But he
did not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;You fellers ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to let us go away empty
handed,&rdquo; the outlaw resumed, wheedlingly, looking
hungrily at the five dead musk-oxen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we let them have some meat?&rdquo; Dick asked
Sandy, without taking his eyes from the outlaws,
who were also covered by the rifles of Sandy and
Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sandy replied. &ldquo;Let them have one of the
musk-oxen. They&rsquo;ll go away and leave us alone
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s sanction to the gift was given by a mere
grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided to let you have one of the musk-oxen
since you&rsquo;re hungry,&rdquo; Dick told the spokesman
of the three. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not because we fear you or
think we owe it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white man turned to the half-breed Indians
and muttered a few words in a foreign tongue. The
boys indicated the musk-oxen farthest away from
them as the one the men should take, and, keeping
their rifles ready for any trickery that might be
enacted, they watched the outlaws hasten forward
and attack the meat with their knives.</p>
<p>Soon the men had the animal quartered and had
slung the fresh meat to their backs. The two half-breeds
turned and climbed back into the ravine with
their load, but the white outlaw tarried for a parting
word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;This country ain&rsquo;t healthy f&rsquo;r you fellers,&rdquo; he
leered at them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; y&rsquo;r a tip on the strength
o&rsquo; this meat. I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m in love with Mistak,
but I reckon I hate the Mounted more. My moniker
is Moonshine Sam, if you fellers want ter know, an&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s the Mounted that&rsquo;s chased me into this God-f&rsquo;rsaken
land. They ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to git me here. Git
that? Not afore I git me two more policemen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s rifle came up quickly at the grim threat in
the outlaw&rsquo;s words, but Moonshine Sam turned
abruptly and followed his companions down into
the ravine.</p>
<p>When the three were out of sight the boys
breathed sighs of relief. It had been a trying ordeal,
and they felt themselves fortunate in coming
through it without blood-shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could have captured them,&rdquo; Sandy expressed
something that had been in Dick&rsquo;s mind also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was too risky,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;You must
remember they were grown men, and among the
most desperate characters the Mounted has to deal
with. If we&rsquo;d tried to capture them they&rsquo;d have
finished us before we reached the home camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy saw the logic in Dick&rsquo;s reasoning and said
no more about it, while they set to work completing
the skinning and quartering of the remaining four
musk-oxen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better haul the meat away from
here before we cache it,&rdquo; Dick advised, when they
were about finished. &ldquo;Those fellows will probably
come back here as soon as we leave, and search for
a cache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it would be a good idea to follow them
for a ways to see where they are going. They
might lead us right to Corporal Thalman&rsquo;s prison,&rdquo;
was Sandy&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible and it&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;But supposing they strike off in some other direction,
and lead us right into the rest of Mistak&rsquo;s
band?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sandy considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take um meat &rsquo;long for way,&rdquo; Toma spoke up
gravely. &ldquo;When find out bad fella not mean to
come back here, cache meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the thing to do!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick.
&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t lose any time that way and we&rsquo;ll be pretty
sure the meat will not be stolen when we come back
after it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the fresh meat was loaded onto
the long sledge and they were once more on the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>The outlaws had had time to travel about half
a mile before the boys set out on their trail, and
even Toma&rsquo;s keen eyes saw no sign of them as they
wound down the ravine. Dick hoped, as Sandy had,
that the outlaws might lead them to the vicinity of
Corporal Thalman&rsquo;s prison. Yet, when two miles on
the trail, the snowshoe tracks they were following
swung toward the sea, Dick knew no such good
fortune was destined to be theirs. Half hoping the
outlaws might turn toward the glacier again, the
boys kept on following them for a short time, but
soon gave up, deciding to depend entirely upon the
map to guide them.</p>
<p>Tracing the back trail until they reached the point
where they had turned north after the outlaws, the
boys halted to cache their meat, since they were now
reasonably certain that Mistak&rsquo;s men did not intend
to come back looking for it.</p>
<p>They first buried all the meat, except enough for
four days&rsquo; rations, in a deep snow bank. Then, from
a nearby patch of boulder strewn slope they carried
a great many stones, erecting a sort of monument
over the cache to prevent its being torn up by foxes.
Over this cairn, they threw snow until it resembled,
from a distance, the rest of the snowdrift. About a
hundred feet north of the cache a small pile of stones
was placed, as a landmark provided a storm came
and obliterated all other signs of the cache.</p>
<p>The job of stowing the meat completed, the boys
once more set out for the glacier. Driving fast, they
reached the towering walls of ice and snow in about
an hour. Calling a halt they surveyed with sinking
hearts the tremendous task that lay before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if this is the place where Mistak climbed
the glacier with his prisoner,&rdquo; Dick speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me like a mountain goat would have a
hard time getting to the top from this point,&rdquo; said
Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heap big job get um sledge up ice from here.
Look &rsquo;long wall. Maybe find easy place,&rdquo; suggested
Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d better do,&rdquo; Sandy agreed
with the young Indian.</p>
<p>Dick also thought it best they should look for an
easier place to climb, and so they turned to the right
under the walls of the glacier and drove the dog
team slowly along, their necks craned upward.</p>
<p>The grumbling noises in the bowels of the glacier
gave cause for grave concern in the minds of the
boys and they fell silent, dreading more and more
the peril of ascending that mountain of ice.</p>
<p>Not far from the place where they had first approached
the glacier, they found the walls split as
by a giant&rsquo;s axe and a great gorge led upward at a
slant which promised fairly easy climbing. Turning
into this they started upward.</p>
<p>A quarter mile of steady climbing, covered by
helping the dogs with the supply sledge, and they
found themselves about a hundred feet above the
tundra. Here, they paused for a much needed rest.
Probably five minutes they had sat in the snow,
gathering strength for the next lap of the climb,
when a low rumble fell upon their ears which seemed
nearer than any other noises they had heard from
the glacier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>With faces paling, the boys listened intently, while
the rumble increased to a roar, growing steadily
nearer.</p>
<p>Dick leaped up and looked up the gorge, a sudden
suspicion leaping in his mind that froze him with
consternation.</p>
<p>He was about to speak when the unmistakable
sound of crashing, moving ice was borne to his ears.
Around a bend in the gorge appeared a gigantic
mass of snow, ice and stones which struck the opposite
wall of the gorge with a shock that made the
earth tremble under foot and sent a shower of fine
ice and snow high into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run for your lives!&rdquo; cried Dick hoarsely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
an avalanche, and we&rsquo;re right in its path!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">BURIED IN A SNOW SLIDE</span></h2>
<p>Fear lent wings to the three boys as they saw the
awful wall of snow and ice bounding down the
gorge upon them. With one accord they rushed toward
the steep slope on their left, scrambling up it
in frantic efforts to gain a height out of reach of
the avalanche, before it descended and crushed them
under its ponderous plunging weight.</p>
<p>The dog team sensed its peril instinctively and
struggled after the boys, dragging the heavy sledge
behind them. Toma, slightly in the rear, grasped
the sledge and began helping the dogs in their unequal
fight for safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the sledge go!&rdquo; shouted Dick to the young
Indian. &ldquo;Save yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the courageous Toma did not heed. Stubbornly,
he stayed by the sledge, falling far behind
his companions.</p>
<p>Then, with a roar that shook the walls of the
gorge as if an earthquake had occurred, the avalanche
plunged past on its way to the tundra far
below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Dick and Sandy barely escaped the flying ice and
stones and with a cry of despair they saw Toma
with the sledge and dog team vanish in a swirl of
flying snow.</p>
<p>The avalanche thundered on, sight and sound of
it dying away down the gorge as quickly as it had
come. Dick and Sandy were left high on the wall
of the desolate gorge, gazing with sad eyes at the
point where Toma and the dog team had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened so suddenly I can hardly realize it,&rdquo;
Sandy spoke in a low voice. &ldquo;Poor Toma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give up hope yet,&rdquo; Dick declared grimly.
&ldquo;Toma was not caught by the full force of the
avalanche. You must remember he and the dogs
were almost out of the way when they were hit.
Let&rsquo;s look along the slope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy followed Dick to the bottom of the gorge,
and the two began picking their way along the path
of the avalanche. Every now and then huge masses
of snow, left adhering to the walls of the gorge,
loosened and fell, starting miniature snow slides in
their wake, but Dick and Sandy kept their eyes open
and managed to avoid these dangers by a wide
margin.</p>
<p>They had retraced their upward trail about two
hundred yards when there was borne to their ears
the faint but unmistakable bark of a dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Dick grasped Sandy&rsquo;s arm, as they
stopped dead still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Again there echoed in the canyon the sharp bark
of an excited dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like one of our Eskimo dogs,&rdquo; Sandy
spoke in a subdued voice, scarcely able to believe
his ears. &ldquo;But for the life of me I can&rsquo;t tell where
it comes from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk on a little further,&rdquo; Dick suggested.</p>
<p>They continued on their way for a few steps, then
stopped again. The dog had barked again, and now
the sound seemed to come from above and behind
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not shout Toma&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; said Sandy. &ldquo;If
he&rsquo;s alive he&rsquo;ll hear us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick thought this an excellent idea and in unison
they raised their voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma! Toma!&rdquo; they shouted at the tops of
their lungs, and paused to listen intently.</p>
<p>A second of silence, then the faraway crags of
the glacier threw back their cries like mocking
laughter.</p>
<p>Drawing deep breaths for another shout, they
hesitated. Several dogs had commenced to bark,
and were making a veritable bedlam of racket, what
with the echoes that were flying about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our dogs!&rdquo; ejaculated the amazed boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Toma may be alive,&rdquo; Dick sang out,
charging up the slope of the gorge, with Sandy close
at his heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Half way up the side of the gorge they came
suddenly upon the dogs in a snow filled ledge. There
were ten of the twelve dogs alive and well, the other
two had been crushed to death under a huge boulder
deposited there by the avalanche. The sledge of
supplies, badly twisted and smashed, lay overturned,
half-buried in the snow, but still hitched to the
tangled dogs. Eagerly the boys searched the wreckage,
but at first there was no sign of Toma. Then
one of the dogs, whining plaintively, began pawing
into a heap of packed snow. The boys rushed to the
dog and found he had uncovered a boot. Silently,
the boys attacked the packed snow with mittens and
boots, and in five minutes they dragged their young
Indian friend free of the lodged snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray he&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo; Dick implored, as they lay the
quiet form upon some sledge packing.</p>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s dark face was darker still, as if he had
smothered, yet as the boys chafed his hands and
listened for heart beats, a flicker of eye lashes showed
a sign of life. Redoubling their efforts to bring the
boy back, they were finally rewarded by a deep sigh
from the dusky lips, and presently Toma&rsquo;s dark
eyes were open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; Toma grunted as he sat up uncertainly,
and vigorously shook himself like a big dog.
&ldquo;No can breathe under snow. Think um see
Happy Hunting Grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us how it all happened,&rdquo; Sandy urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not know much,&rdquo; Toma blinked, &ldquo;come too
quick. Something hit me. I see many stars, an&rsquo;
whirl, whirl in snow. Feel like fly like bird, then
big bump. All still. I can no breathe. All get like
night, then I see you fellas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overjoyed at the recovery of Toma, the boys
could do little but discuss the narrow escape for
some time. Finally they set to work untangling the
dogs, and when that was done they started to repair
the sledge.</p>
<p>It took more than three hours to fix the sledge
so it was worthy of the trail, but they at last had the
worst breaks spliced and lashed with leather thongs.
By this time they were all so tired that they decided
to pitch camp and fix something to eat. This they
did as soon as they were on the floor of the gorge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to be afraid of any more snow
slides for some time to come,&rdquo; Dick relieved their
fears in that direction. &ldquo;All the loose ice and stones
was cleared out by that big avalanche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After an appetizing meal of broiled musk-ox, the
boys slept for several hours. When they awakened
they noticed for the first time a change in the sunlight,
and were concerned at the approach of winter
which this signaled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems strange to see evening come again,&rdquo; remarked
Sandy. &ldquo;Wonder how it would feel to go
to bed in honest-to-goodness darkness again?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t get a move on we&rsquo;ll get more darkness
than we want,&rdquo; said Dick, referring to the
approach of the Arctic&rsquo;s long night.</p>
<p>But when the boys started up the gorge again it
was no darker. So far, all the night they were to
experience for a few weeks was to be several hours
of twilight.</p>
<p>Not far up the gorge, beyond the point where
the avalanche had narrowly missed destroying them,
Dick called the attention of his chum to three tiny
figures walking along the rim of the gorge above
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if those men could be Moonshine Sam
and his two companions,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had
just about time to come this far if they had headed
this way shortly after we stopped trailing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope they won&rsquo;t try any monkeyshines
like starting another avalanche,&rdquo; Sandy shivered.
&ldquo;When I die I don&rsquo;t want to get that kind of a sendoff
for the Happy Hunting Grounds. What do you
say, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Indian grunted his emphatic sanction
of Sandy&rsquo;s preferences, while all three watched the
men on the cliff. The men they thought might be
Moonshine Sam and the two half-breeds from Mistak&rsquo;s
band, kept abreast of the boys for nearly a
half hour, then as the gorge began to grow shallower
upon nearing the plateau down from which it led,
they disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they ever get wind of the fact that we know
Corporal Thalman is still alive, our lives won&rsquo;t be
worth a cent,&rdquo; Dick expressed his thoughts aloud.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll put an end to Corporal Thalman right away,
too, if they think for a minute we have a chance to
rescue him&mdash;if they haven&rsquo;t done that already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys hurried on, and soon came out of the
gorge upon what they were quite sure was the top
of the glacier. An icy wind, that cut to the very
marrow of their bones, blew across the vast, white
field of ice. But they struck out bravely across the
lonely forbidding desert of the north, hoping soon to
locate the first of the three main fissures marked
on the map.</p>
<p>They were now traveling southwest with the sun
in their eyes, and for the first time since they saw
genuine &ldquo;sun-dogs.&rdquo; The phenomenon was intensely
interesting and for a time attracted almost all their
attention. The sun-dogs were in the form of four
miniature suns situated one above, one below, and
one on either side of the big disc of light that was
the source of them. They were not really suns,
however, but reflections of the sun upon the countless
particles of frost in the air. One of the &ldquo;dogs&rdquo;
was somewhat like the rainbow, for it seemed to
hang just a few feet ahead of the dog team, dancing
just out of reach, like a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, as they
plodded along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Then they came upon a deep fissure in the glacier
which temporarily crowded the sun-dogs out of their
minds. The crack was not an exceptionally large one
in comparison to other glacial fissures they had seen,
being only about four feet across at the widest
points. Several smaller fissures were indicated on
the map as preceding the first main fissure, so the
boys crossed the gap by jumping, improvising a
bridge with the sledge for those dogs to cross over
which were too stubborn to make the leap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be misled after all by these fissures,&rdquo;
Dick spoke when they had resumed their journey
&ldquo;New cracks form pretty often, and it&rsquo;s possible
the main fissures Corporal Thalman observed while
Mistak was taking him to the prison pit are not the
main ones any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; Sandy replied.
&ldquo;A lot of small fissures might show up in eight
months&rsquo; time, but these big fissures are very old and
they wouldn&rsquo;t change much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time they had reached another small fissure,
about the size of the first one, but much longer.
As far as they could see on either side of them the
crooked crack stretched away like a huge, black
snake, wriggling across the snow-bound glacier roof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Keeping a rough account of the miles they had
traversed since reaching the top of the glacier, they
believed the first main fissure could not be far away
according to the map. An hour after crossing the
first small fissure, they reached what they were almost
certain was the first main fissure. In places
it yawned to an unestimable depth, and at many
points was more than twenty feet in width. After
sledging along the rim of it for a half mile they
located a natural bridge of ice over which they
crossed without mishap.</p>
<p>Excited by their success so far, they increased
their pace, again crossing numerous small chasms
in the glacier before arriving at the rim of the second
main fissure. This they finally contrived to bridge
at a point where a jutting ice ledge partly spanned
the seemingly bottomless void.</p>
<p>From there on, the top of the glacier ceased to be
level. Great holes yawned everywhere amidst heaps
of shattered ice many feet in height. Apparently, at
some time years ago, two divisions of the glacier
had met there in their slow progress, crumbling their
giant fronts upon one another.</p>
<p>In the midst of the veritable &ldquo;bad lands&rdquo; of ice
they came upon what they were reasonably certain
was the third main fissure, somewhere at the bottom
of which was the pit in which Corporal Thalman had
been imprisoned. But the immensity of the task still
ahead of them awed the boys. For, though they had
reached the fissure, it was miles long and they had
no way of judging any nearer than five or ten
miles just where the prison pit was located.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to do but look for a way of
climbing down to the bottom of the fissure,&rdquo; Dick
finally spoke. &ldquo;Mistak must know a way to get
down there, and if we look long enough, we can
find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we ought to wait until the policemen get
here,&rdquo; Sandy expressed his doubts, while gazing
down into the black chasm that was the main fissure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s best we keep on trying since we&rsquo;ve come
this far without any fatal accidents. Corporal McCarthy
can trail us wherever we go, so there&rsquo;s no
need waiting for him and the Constable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys set out along the glacier looking for a
place that offered possibilities of descent into the fissure.
It was slow going over the heaps of shattered
ice, and before they had gone a mile they were worn
out. They halted to rest in a shallow pit which protected
them from the cold wind. As they sat there,
Dick noticed that a small fissure about three feet
wide and as high as a man&rsquo;s head opened out of a
bulwark of ice in front of them. The crack seemed
to lead downward at a sharp slant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hole looks like it might lead down to the
bottom of the fissure,&rdquo; Dick said to Sandy and
Toma. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into it and investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>After resting a few more minutes, they got up
and walked into the passage. Advancing cautiously,
they reached an underground chamber, about twenty
feet long, ten feet wide, and somewhat higher than
their heads. The sunlight reached the chamber
through its entrance and the dim rays lighted up a
very beautiful scene. The walls and roof of the
natural cavity were formed of crystallized moisture,
shaped in many grotesque and fantastic figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe this is part of the crystal grottoes Corporal
Thalman mentioned in his message!&rdquo; Dick
exclaimed examining the glittering walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we just found the outlet that the Corporal
failed to find,&rdquo; Sandy brightened.</p>
<p>But upon investigating further they were disappointed.
The first chamber led into a second and
smaller chamber which had no outlet, and seemed
the end of the cavern.</p>
<p>After sounding the walls to make certain they
could not break into a larger cavity, the boys made
their way back to the narrow passage leading up to
the outer air.</p>
<p>Dick went first, and as he stopped into the sunlight
a premonition of danger seized him. But before
he could act to defend himself, a shadow was
flung across his path and a heavy weight descended
upon his head and shoulders. Dick went to the ice,
stunned and half-blinded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">A RACE WITH DEATH</span></h2>
<p>Dick was stunned only a moment, but when his
head cleared he found himself pinioned by a powerful
man, who had just lashed his hands behind him
with thongs. Nearby, Sandy and Toma struggled
in the clutches of four men. At a little distance away
stood Mistak, the half-breed Eskimo, leering with
malevolent triumph upon his captives.</p>
<p>When the boys were completely subdued and their
arms tied behind them, Mistak came forward and
searched them. He found nothing in Sandy&rsquo;s and
Toma&rsquo;s clothing which seemed to interest him, but
Dick&rsquo;s shirt pocket disclosed the map, and filling the
air with French and Eskimo curses, the outlaw saw
the handiwork of the imprisoned policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you sink to save him!&rdquo; Mistak glared at Dick.
&ldquo;I get you in time, yes? Ha! By gar, you nevair
meddle wiz Fred Mistak&rsquo;s business more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Mistak&rsquo;s evil intentions were only too evident,
and Dick was about to give up hope, when Toma
cocked his head to one side in a listening attitude.
Dick knew the Indian youth had far keener hearing
than the average person, and felt his hopes once
more rising. Whatever Toma heard, it was of
some favorable significance, for he looked squarely
at Dick and solemnly winked one eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you like find zee lost policeman?&rdquo; Mistak
taunted, stepping squarely in front of Dick. &ldquo;I
take you zere&mdash;what you say? Ver&rsquo; fine, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say to that,&rdquo; Dick replied as
sternly as possible, &ldquo;but I do know we have friends
near and that you will suffer for any harm that
comes to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; Mistak laughed coarsely, turning to
his companion. &ldquo;Hear what zee puppy say? They
have frien&rsquo; in Mistak&rsquo; country. Not ver&rsquo; near, eh?
Ha! Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at the instant of Mistak&rsquo;s triumph that a
rifle shot rang out and one of Mistak&rsquo;s men threw
up his hands and fell silently to the ice. The half-breed
Eskimo staggered back, his face paling, and
his mouth twisted in a hideous smile.</p>
<p>Again the hidden rifle cracked, accompanied by
another, whereupon Mistak&rsquo;s men ducked and ran
under the deadly bullets raining about them, leaving
the boys where they had been captured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To zee pit!&rdquo; the boys heard Mistak shriek to his
men. &ldquo;Kill zee policeman before zey come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mistak and his men disappeared, and almost upon
their heels leaped the two fur-clad forms of Corporal
McCarthy and Constable Sloan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>In a trice they had slashed the bonds of the boys
and had set them free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Mistak all of you!&rdquo; cried Corporal McCarthy,
plunging on across the ice after the fleeing
outlaws.</p>
<p>Dick kept pace with the Corporal and shouted
into his ear: &ldquo;Mistak is going to kill Corporal Thalman.
He&rsquo;s making for the pit now. You were just
in time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came as fast as we could get here as soon
as we got back to camp and found the map and instructions,&rdquo;
panted the policeman. &ldquo;Good work you
fellows have done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the fleeing outlaws vanished into the
yawning mouth of a cavern that led downward at a
steep angle. Slipping and sliding most of the way,
the policemen and the boys tumbled after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt! Halt!&rdquo; bellowed Corporal McCarthy when
they had reached a more level incline. But Mistak&rsquo;s
men did not heed. Instead, the report of a rifle
sounded like a thunder clap in the underground
chamber and a bullet richochetted with a rattling
noise along the walls of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re shooting back at us!&rdquo; cried Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>In spite of the danger the policemen led the way
on at a reckless run. Down, down, they went through
the dimly lighted corridors of a subterranean vault.
When it seemed to them they had gone down for
nearly five hundred feet, the cavern swiftly became
level and lighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to run into the bottom of the fissure
now!&rdquo; panted Dick hoarsely.</p>
<p>Dick was right. The light grew stronger swiftly
and a moment later they saw Mistak and his three
men silhouetted in an opening as they ran out of
the cavern.</p>
<p>Presently they burst out upon the frozen floor
of a narrow canyon-like passage that was apparently
the bottom of the fissure. Far above the sky showed
like a tiny, pale ribbon. They could hear the sound
of the running outlaws&rsquo; boots on the hard surface of
the bottom of the fissure and followed them to the
right. The passage was crooked and they could see
nothing ahead of them further than ten yards, but at
length they came upon the scene of Mistak&rsquo;s contemplated
perfidy.</p>
<p>Two half-breeds were at work over a hole some
ten feet in diameter. With their spears they were
straining frantically to pry loose a huge lump of ice
and send it hurtling into the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to crush the Corporal with that
cake of ice!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve reached the pit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>The rifles of the policemen came swiftly to their
shoulders, and the great fissure reverberated with
two shots. One of the half-breeds staggered and
sank upon his side, lying still. The other grasped
his shoulder with one hand, as if he had been
wounded, turned and ran around a bend in the walls
of the fissure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t follow them!&rdquo; was Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s
command. &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em go this time. We must get
Thalman out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon they were crowded about the dark round
opening of the prison pit, and were shouting down
into the darkness. In the silence that followed their
shouts down into the hole, they could hear their
own hearts beating. Was Corporal Thalman alive?</p>
<p>At last, as from another world, there was wafted
up out of the dark hole, a faint voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;friends. Pretty&mdash;weak&mdash;but&mdash;still&mdash;kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Thalman!&rdquo; whispered Constable Sloan
hoarsely. &ldquo;I can hardly believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get a rope!&rdquo; Corporal McCarthy
bellowed down to the prisoner. &ldquo;Hold on, and we&rsquo;ll
soon get you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wild laugh echoed up from the depths in answer,
as if the prisoner was about to lose his mind.</p>
<p>Constable Sloan was already on the run for the
rope. He came back in about twenty minutes, having
lost no time in finding his way up the cavern to
the surface of the glacier where the sledges were.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Hastily they began lowering the long coil down
into the hole. After nearly fifty feet had been payed
out, Corporal Thalman jerked on the rope to signal
he had it in his hands, then they all waited tensely
while he tied it securely under his shoulders. At
last came the call from the pit that all was ready.
All hands grasped the rope then, and began to
heave it upward, hand over hand.</p>
<p>It was a strange caricature of a man that at last
appeared dangling in the loop. He was pale as a
ghost from his long sojourn underground, and a long
beard covered the lower part of his face and chest.
So thin was he that his bones seemed on the point
of bursting through his skin. The prisoner&rsquo;s clothing
was in tatters and immediately upon striking
the upper air he began to shiver from the cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get him to the sledges quick!&rdquo; ordered
Corporal McCarthy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s blankets up there,
and we&rsquo;ll make some hot tea for him. Just our luck
to have him pass in his checks just after we&rsquo;ve saved
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a hard struggle to climb out of the cavern
with the almost helpless man, but they finally accomplished
the task.</p>
<p>Once Corporal Thalman had been wrapped in
blankets and furs and treated to a few cups of piping
hot tea, he showed signs of returning strength.
However, the policemen were in favor of returning
with him immediately to the base of supplies where
everything necessary for his complete recovery
could be obtained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you boys are elected for the job of hauling
Corporal Thalman to the main camp,&rdquo; Corporal
McCarthy told them. &ldquo;Sloan and I will stay here
for another try at trapping that sly fox, Mistak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But with only one sledge, and that loaded with
Corporal Thalman, we can&rsquo;t haul in the cache of
meat on the back trail,&rdquo; Dick explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; retorted the policeman. &ldquo;Come
back after it when you have Thalman safe in a warm
igloo with plenty of hot tea and food nearby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with much regret that the boys bade good-bye
to the policemen once more and started out on
the back trail, Corporal Thalman snugly tucked in
on the sledge.</p>
<p>Two days later, having traveled slow, for the comfort
of their passenger, the boys reached the base of
supplies. Sipsa and the other natives seemed overjoyed
to see their young white friends again, and
they held a feast in honor of the occasion, since
hunting had been so good and they had more meat
than they needed for the winter.</p>
<p>The day after the home-coming, Sandy was left
to care for Corporal Thalman, while Dick and Toma
returned to haul in the cache of musk-ox meat.
They found the meat unmolested, and in fine condition,
however, the signs in the snow about the
cache showed that numerous foxes had made a vain
effort to scratch away the stones and get at the
meat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>A high wind was blowing upon their backs when
Dick and Toma pulled in at the supply base with
their precious load of meat. Two hours later the
wind had risen to cyclonic velocity, sweeping tons
and tons of snow through the air until the sun was
blotted out and the igloos trembled to their strong
foundations.</p>
<p>The storm was warning of winter and Dick and
Sandy were much concerned over the safety of the
policemen. Under warm shelter the men might
weather the blizzard for days, provided they did not
run out of food and fuel oil. If they did&mdash; Dick and
Sandy shuddered to think of what such privations
would mean for Corporal McCarthy and the Constable.</p>
<p>Three days the wind howled and shrieked and tore
at the tiny knot of igloos under the high ridge, while
the tormented sea roared and pounded on the beach,
heaving great projectiles of ice far up on the land
with deafening crashes.</p>
<p>The third day the wind laid, and several hours
afterward, two half frozen men staggered into the
camp. Dick had just looked out of an igloo upon
the new world of white, when he saw the two figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy! A rifle quick!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s two of
Mistak&rsquo;s men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no weapon was needed. The men were about
dead on their feet and were unarmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>The foremost man gave a hoarse shout upon seeing
Dick and flung up an arm to cover his eyes as if
he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Moonshine Sam!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed to Sandy,
who had joined him at the igloo door.</p>
<p>Moonshine Sam it was who staggered up to the
boys and threw himself upon his face in the snow,
his companion dropping to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; moaned Moonshine Sam to the
boys as they bent over him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather let the law
do its worst than stay in this hell-hole any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy dragged the two outlaws into
their igloo, one by one, putting on some tea for
them. They could not bear to see even those hardened
criminals suffer.</p>
<p>Inside, they found both the half-breed&rsquo;s hands
frozen as hard as stones. Moonshine Sam&rsquo;s left foot
was frozen just as bad, and both men&rsquo;s faces were
black. The hot tea and warmth of the igloo made
the men delirious, and Moonshine Sam especially,
babbled ceaselessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll git ye! It&rsquo;ll git ye!&rdquo; he repeated many times,
writhing with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dick asked the outlaw solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Har! Har!&rdquo; the man laughed madly. &ldquo;Out there,
fool!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The white things! Mistak an&rsquo; the
north!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>Both Dick and Sandy did their best to quiet the
raving outlaw, but to no avail. One moment he was
cursing everything alive, and swearing to kill all the
mounted police in Canada; the next moment he became
as fearful as a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll save me from him,&rdquo; he clutched at Dick
with clawing fingers. &ldquo;Ye won&rsquo;t let the &lsquo;white Eskimo&rsquo;
git me,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>By fragments the story of Moonshine Sam&rsquo;s experience
in the blizzard came out. There had been
a division in the band, Mistak and Moonshine Sam
quarreling and going their separate ways. Only one
half-breed had had the courage to mutiny against
Fred Mistak, and follow the white man. The two
had been caught out in the storm with no food, dogs,
or sleeping bags. Only by chance had they reached
the igloos of the policemen&rsquo;s encampment.</p>
<p>It was hours before Moonshine Sam finally fell
into a troubled sleep, and the boys could seek rest
themselves.</p>
<p>When they awakened, Toma was bending over
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police come back. They in igloo. Want you
come to them,&rdquo; said the young Indian.</p>
<p>Outside, on the way to the policemen&rsquo;s igloo, the
boys found dusk upon the desolate land. Only a
rim of the sun shed its fiery radiance upon an overhang
of dull, gray clouds. Winter was overtaking
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The boys found two gaunt and grim men when
they crawled into the snow house of the two officers.
Constable Sloan had been wounded in an ambush
perpetrated by Mistak, shortly after the boys had
started back to camp with Thalman. Mistak had
bested them for the present, Corporal McCarthy was
forced to admit, but the question was, should they
give up and go south before winter, leaving Mistak
free in his fastnesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to you, Corporal McCarthy,&rdquo; Dick
and Sandy replied as one. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the commander
of this expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;m for staying here,&rdquo; went on the
officer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Mistak if I die in the attempt, and
I mean what I say. Sloan swears he&rsquo;ll stick by me,
but that&rsquo;s no reason why the rest of you should. If
you start tomorrow you can go by sledge to the
nearest seaport and book passage back to Canada
before you get caught in the long night, and travel
is made unsafe. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t quit,&rdquo; Dick returned, pale but determined.
&ldquo;Sandy and I want to see this to a finish
and Corporal Thalman swore only yesterday that
he&rsquo;d never let us take him back until Mistak went
with him, or was left behind for the foxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake,&rdquo; Corporal McCarthy extended a hard
hand, and Dick and Sandy grasped it in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a couple of kids you&rsquo;re the nerviest he-men
I ever met with,&rdquo; Sloan spoke up, a courageous grin
on his pain drawn face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll second that,&rdquo; hastened Corporal McCarthy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>When Dick and Sandy left the igloo, they walked
very straight, and they were silent. The dreaded
long night of the northland was close at hand and
they must stand up under hardships more terrible
than they had either ever endured, for, had Constable
Sloan not called them &ldquo;the nerviest he-men I
ever met with?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE LONG NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>The last of the sun was seen October 18th. Corporal
McCarthy had been forced to take charge of
the camp until Constable Sloan recovered from his
wounds, and so the long-thwarted capture of Mistak,
the white Eskimo, was due for another long
delay under the pitchy blackness of the Arctic night.</p>
<p>Moonshine Sam recovered, and was kept constantly
under guard, though he repeated again and
again his promises to keep the peace if he were put
on parole. The half-breed, who had staggered into
camp with the white outlaw, died from exposure,
and was buried, under a cairn of stones a few miles
from camp.</p>
<p>Corporal Thalman&rsquo;s iron constitution soon rebuilt
itself, now that he was among friends, and had almost
all he could eat. And so the little garrison
was stronger by one more man.</p>
<p>Under the smothering darkness that now had
descended upon the land, time passed as if the hours
were days, the weeks months, and a month a year.
The men and boys contrived games of all kinds to
play indoors, yet they had to economize on their fuel
oil, and whenever they could, they slept away the
hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>It was with great joy that they greeted the coming
of the moon that first month of uninterrupted
darkness. Fortunately fair weather came along
with the bright disc in the Heavens, and everyone
sallied forth to hunt and play in the open air.</p>
<p>The policemen went some distance inland during
the period, but due to the liability of the weather
to change for the worst at any hour, they dared not
go on any protracted search for Mistak. They did,
however, bring in three musk-oxen and a polar
bear.</p>
<p>Dick, Sandy, and Toma all became proficient,
during the moonlight period, in a game of throw
and catch which the Eskimos played. It was great
fun and required no little skill. A long stick, perforated
with small holes was employed, together
with a walrus tusk, sharpened to a point. The stick
was thrown into the air and caught in one of the
holes upon the ivory point.</p>
<p>There were also foot races and snowshoe races
in which the mounted police joined, along with the
Eskimos and the boys. Weight lifting, wrestling,
and other tests of strength were also favorite pastimes
of the Eskimos and were invaluable in counteracting
the depressing effects of the moonlight
and the eternal darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Constable Sloan told them that the moon would
remain in the sky from eight to ten days. A storm
fell upon them, however, after seven days and nights
of moonlight, and they were all forced to hibernate
in their igloos to escape the bitter cold and heavy
darkness.</p>
<p>During the second period of utter darkness, the
thermometers all froze and burst, except those
especially designed for use in the Arctic. Sandy
fell sick with a bad cold that threatened to develop
into pneumonia, and lay abed two weeks before
Dick&rsquo;s continuous nursing brought his chum through
safely.</p>
<p>Bundled in furs hour after hour, in their sleeping
bags and out, all suffered immeasurably from the
close and stifling air of the igloos. The Eskimos
rubbed themselves with oil in order to soften their
skins and file their pores, but it was some time
before the boys could bring themselves to apply
the messy stuff in place of their old friend soap and
water. But as soon as they did, they felt much
better. For their clothing no longer chaffed them
and the bite of the low temperature was considerably
lessened.</p>
<p>Moonshine Sam became a greater trial with the
passing of every hour. He lapsed into strange spells
that seemed to be brought on by the oppressive darkness
and the terrible hardships he had weathered
while with Mistak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll git him, er he&rsquo;ll git me,&rdquo; he would mumble,
starting up out of a stupid trance. Then he would
clench and unclench his red hands, and gnash his
yellow teeth in a frightful rage.</p>
<p>He finally grew so violent that the policemen no
longer would permit the boys to take their turns
watching him, doing it all among the three of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hate to see him and Mistak come to blows,
Corporal Thalman shuddered, after coming off of
a two-hour watch in Moonshine Sam&rsquo;s igloo. &ldquo;One
or both of them would pass in his checks before the
fight was over. I guess the white Eskimo is pretty
hard on the men that desert him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second period of moonlight came at an inopportune
time. A dense film of clouds obscured it
for four days and the ghostly white snow fields were
almost as dark as when there was no moon. But it
finally cleared off, only to reveal more trouble. The
dogs were dying from attacks of madness. Dick
and Sandy counted twenty-two dead in the snow,
some their own, some belonging to the Eskimos.</p>
<p>After several hours of observation they discovered
a dog in the throes of the polar sickness. The
animal began to whine, then suddenly snarled, and
frothed at the mouth. After biting himself several
times, he ran madly in and out among the igloos,
finally circling far out over the snow. When the
diseased dog finally rushed panting and red-eyed
back to camp, all the other dogs had hidden from
him. Dick shot the dog then to prevent its suffering
any longer. That was the last case of the madness
among the dogs during that phase of the moon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what the Eskimos call Piblockto,&rdquo; Constable
Sloan explained. &ldquo;The Eskimos get it themselves
sometimes, especially the women, though it&rsquo;s not so
fatal among human beings as among dogs. So if
you fellows hear some unearthly screeching you&rsquo;ll
know what it is. Don&rsquo;t bother anyone who gets it
The natives leave them alone unless they start running
away where they&rsquo;re apt to freeze to death. The
fits only last about half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys did not have to wait long before they
saw an actual case of what Constable Sloan had
described.</p>
<p>It happened to an Eskimo woman whose month
old infant had died of exposure, which was a rare
occurrence. Grief stricken, the poor woman was
wandering around among the igloos in the moonlight,
wailing softly to herself, when the boys
chanced to pass her on their way to the policemen&rsquo;s
igloo.</p>
<p>Their hair raised under their parkas as suddenly
the woman let out a most blood-curdling scream,
leaped into the air several times, and finally commenced
to tear her clothes off, piece by piece. Dick
and Sandy ran behind an igloo and watched from
hiding. Several Eskimos appeared from various
igloos, and the boys could hear them babbling about
piblockto and the angekok. They gathered that the
Eskimos believed the woman was temporarily possessed
by one of the bad spirits that haunted the
northland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>The Eskimos did not attempt to do anything for
the poor woman until she had torn away so much
of her warm clothing that she stood in danger of
freezing to death. Then three men came out and
dragged her, shrieking into an igloo. Presently
her screams died away and all was quiet.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy hurried on their way, their flesh
still creeping from the scene they had witnessed.
But before the moon had once more dropped down
under the horizon, they saw several of these attacks
of piblockto and became somewhat accustomed to
them.</p>
<p>It was in January, during the dark of the moon,
that some mysterious enemy began his depredations.
First, two dogs were stumbled upon in the dark,
their heads crushed in by an axe, and part of their
haunches cut away. Next, an Eskimo youth, out to
bring in some snow for melting, crawled back to his
igloo, hours later, wounded by a spear. Several
other Eskimos were pursued by some animal the
nature of which they could not detect in the pitchy
blackness. Sandy swore that once, when he was
about to venture out of the igloo to see how the
weather was, that he had touched a cold face with
one hand, and that a darker blot in the darkness
had melted out of sight, without making any sound
in the snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Finally, no one but the policemen dared to venture
often into the dark, and they only with a
weapon handy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my own ideas as to what this ghost is,&rdquo;
Dick told Sandy. &ldquo;The policemen think the same
as I do, too. It&rsquo;s as simple as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo; Sandy wanted to know, as
he cut a new wick for a seal oil lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mistak, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, how is it that he can see in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t, any more than we can,&rdquo; Dick replied.
&ldquo;He just prowls around, and when he runs into
someone he takes the chance to put a scare into all
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds reasonable,&rdquo; admitted Sandy. &ldquo;But, gee,
I don&rsquo;t like the idea of him hanging around. Suppose
he should take a notion to attack us. We&rsquo;d
be just about helpless in these igloos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick realized Sandy was right and he spoke to
Corporal McCarthy about it as soon as he came in
off a watch at Moonshine Sam&rsquo;s igloo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mistak has the nerve to attack us,&rdquo;
Corporal McCarthy replied. &ldquo;The fellow is sly as
a fox, but he&rsquo;s afraid of the police, don&rsquo;t you believe
he isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The following interminable night seemed to prove
Corporal McCarthy right in his opinion that Mistak
lacked the daring to perpetrate an open attack. Yet
that did not prevent the outlaw from continuing
his strike and run tactics. No one could feel safe
with these skulking enemies waiting in the pitchy
blackness of the Arctic night to kill, maim or steal.</p>
<p>Then, thirty-six hours before they anticipated the
return of the moon, Sandy disappeared. He had
gone to Moonshine Sam&rsquo;s igloo with meat for Constable
Sloan then on watch, and had neither returned
to his igloo nor reported to his destination. A
blundering search of the vicinity in the darkness
proved futile, and he could not be located in any of
the Eskimo igloos.</p>
<p>Alive to the danger which would threaten Sandy
if he were lost in the vast land of darkness, Dick
appealed to Corporal McCarthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how you feel, and I wish we could do
something, but it&rsquo;s useless to hunt blindly for him,&rdquo;
the Corporal replied regretfully. &ldquo;We must hope
he turns up by himself or that some of the Eskimos
happen to run onto him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Mistak or some of the other outlaws
might have attacked him?&rdquo; Dick asked falteringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be lying if I said that wasn&rsquo;t possible. I
don&rsquo;t like to think the worst any more than you do.
Anyhow, we know Sandy McClaren is pretty well
able to take care of himself. There&rsquo;s no danger of
him laying down and dying while he&rsquo;s an ounce of
strength left to find his way back to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Dick was forced to accept this as his only comfort
for the present. But as the hours passed and Sandy
did not show up, the suspense became unbearable.
A host of questions thronged and tormented his
worried mind. Could Sandy, if lost, hold out until
the moon came up to light the way for him and a
searching party? Had Mistak captured him and imprisoned
him? Or had the outlaws brutally murdered
him?</p>
<p>But one thing Dick was thankful for&mdash;the
weather remained fair, with no wind, and a temperature
as high as fifteen degrees below zero, warm
for the Arctic winter.</p>
<p>As the time drew near for the reappearance of the
moon, Dick did not sleep at all, but paced up and
down on the packed snow in front of his igloo.
He was there when the first pale, cold, faint light
stole over the snow, and with a cry of gladness, he
turned to the bleak horizon, where the edge of a
yellow disc had just appeared as the moon rose.</p>
<p>Corporal McCarthy was quickly at Dick&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;We can start a search right away now,&rdquo; said the
officer sympathetically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have two parties of Eskimos
start on in different directions, one led by
Sipsa, and one by Constable Sloan. Corporal Thalman
can take charge of Moonshine Sam while we&rsquo;re
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>The searching parties were hastily organized, and
started off. Corporal McCarthy, Dick and Toma
formed a third party. They started out at the beaten
path between Dick&rsquo;s igloo and Moonshine Sam&rsquo;s. It
was from there they were quite certain Sandy had
vanished. But the vicinity of the path and the
village of igloos was so criss-crossed with tracks
that they could make no headway. So, striking out
blindly, they headed southward, while the other divisions
of the searchers took the remaining three
directions.</p>
<p>Outside the vicinity of the encampment where the
snow was unbroken, they began walking back and
forth, examining every foot of snow for signs of
Sandy&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>But the snow was covered by a crust several inches
thick, and an ordinary weight made no impression.
Despairingly, they kept on, until at last Dick spied
something glittering in the rays of the moon. Quickly
he ran to the object and picked it up. Renewed
hope was expressed in his loud summons of Toma
and Corporal McCarthy.</p>
<p>What Dick held in his hand when his two companions
arrived, was a hunting knife, in the bone
handle of which had been carved two tell-tale initials&mdash;&ldquo;S.M.&rdquo;!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">A STRANGE TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>Eagerly, the policeman and Toma examined the
knife that Dick had found, which had, without a
doubt, once reposed in Sandy McClaren&rsquo;s sheath.
Yet, after the first flush of excitement had worn
off, they all realized that the clue was a very inadequate
one. In itself it could not lead to Sandy. Only
it served as an added incentive for them to search
more diligently for some more definite trace of the
lost boy.</p>
<p>As they circled slowly, getting farther and farther
from camp, the snow continued to present a hard
crust which had registered no record of the feet that
had passed over it under the impenetrable shroud of
the polar darkness.</p>
<p>But their patience was rewarded when Toma
found a bit of bearskin with the long hair adhering
to it. Upon examining the fur closely, they saw
that it had been slashed from a larger piece of fur
with a knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been cut from Sandy&rsquo;s trousers,&rdquo;
ventured Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; rejoined Corporal McCarthy,
&ldquo;but we just found what seemed to be Sandy&rsquo;s knife.
What did he cut the fur with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Dick nor Toma could answer that question,
and at the time it did not seem important
enough to worry about. Close to a hundred feet
from where they had spied the first bit of bearskin,
they found another fragment of the same kind of
fur. It, too, had been obviously cut with a knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know Sandy has cut off these bits of fur
to mark the way he went,&rdquo; Dick cried excitedly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry on and see where the next one is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After progressing nearly a quarter mile across
the crusted snow, they had picked up nearly twenty
bits of fur similar to the first one Toma had found,
and were certain something more tangible would
soon turn up.</p>
<p>Then the trail of fur fragments disappeared and
was replaced by the imprint of several snowshoes,
as they at last reached soft snow.</p>
<p>All three bent to examine the tracks. There were
three pair of snow-shoe tracks and one pair of small
boot tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boot tracks are Sandy&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m pretty sure,&rdquo;
was Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s confident statement. &ldquo;The
snow-shoe tracks must have been made by those who
captured him, unless someone picked up his trail
after the moon came up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>Hastening onward, they followed an unbroken
trail for nearly a half hour, when they again were
discouraged upon reaching more crusted snow upon
which the trail vanished. But not long were they at
loss. Running ahead a short distance, Dick stooped
and picked up something which he waved triumphantly
to Toma and the Corporal. It was another
bit of bearskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy&rsquo;s started marking his trail again!&rdquo; Dick
called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting so I&rsquo;m not so sure just who has
been leaving these markers,&rdquo; Corporal McCarthy
said. &ldquo;That knife we found back there makes me
wonder if it&rsquo;s really Sandy who has dropped those
pieces of fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, who could it be then?&rdquo; Dick asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; was the policeman&rsquo;s enigmatic
reply. &ldquo;But in the meantime you two fellows
be ready to obey orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wondering what the Corporal was hinting at,
Dick started out to find more of the trail markers.
About every fifty or a hundred feet they found
them, so that there was no doubt as to the fact that
they were going right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>Corporal McCarthy cautioned them to keep their
eyes open now, for they had reached the end of the
level snow and were among some large snowdrifts
formed by huge boulders that had lodged the snow.
Directly over their heads loomed the long upward
slant of the high moraine which had so long served
them as a landmark. However, they were in a part
of the country unfamiliar to them, and so did not
know what to expect. Added to this the moonlight
deceived the eyes, and made it difficult for them to
tell a boulder from a living body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be prepared for an ambush,&rdquo; the Corporal instructed
Dick and Toma. &ldquo;Mistak hasn&rsquo;t taken
Sandy all this distance for nothing. He knew we
would follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But minute after minute passed and there was
no sign of Mistak or his band, nor of Sandy, with
the exception of the clear prints of the snowshoes
leading in and out and around the drifts and boulders.
Like so many ghosts the three trailers hurried
on in the pale moonlight, their snowshoes making
scarcely no sound at all in the feathery drifts.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there broke upon the icy air a mocking
laugh. The three stopped dead in their tracks,
mouths agape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; whispered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him sounded like bad spirit,&rdquo; Toma&rsquo;s voice was
subdued from sudden fright.</p>
<p>Corporal McCarthy said nothing, but his hands
tightened on his rifle while he searched every black
shadow with probing eyes.</p>
<p>Shaken by the eerie sound, they prepared to go
on again, when once more the mad laugh pealed out,
vindictive, vengeful and subtlely mocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a mad man,&rdquo; quavered Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; grated the policeman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some of
that devilish Mistak&rsquo;s work. Anyway the sound
came from ahead of us. Unlimber your rifles, lads,
we&rsquo;re going to see some action, I think. If I&rsquo;m lucky
enough to get a bead on Mistak, I&rsquo;ll never get him
to Canada alive, mark my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crouching, so as to make use of every bit of
shelter, they now moved slowly forward, holding
their breaths for a repetition of the cackle of laughter.
The very boulders themselves now seemed to
be moved in the deceptive moonlight under their
imaginative eyes.</p>
<p>And again they heard the laugh&mdash;ahead of them
yet. On and on they crept, a dew of perspiration
standing out on their foreheads, and freezing there
in tiny drops. But not a sign of any person or thing
did they actually see. Only the frequent peals of
wild laughter urged them fearfully on, like a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp
in some frozen swamp.</p>
<p>The boulder strewn snow presently gave way to
treacherous gashes in the ground made by the erosion
of some age-old glacier. Clambering and sliding
in and out of these precipitous gullies, they kept
on after the elusive laughter.</p>
<p>Long since they had given up following the snowshoe
tracks. The laughter of a man&mdash;even a mad
man was much more tangible than footprints. But
had it not been for the grim, fearless policeman,
Dick and Toma would have turned back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>An end to their reckless advance came in a very
unexpected manner. Clambering out of a steep gully,
they found themselves at the edge of a trackless
expanse of soft white snow, apparently as level as
a floor and just as solid footing. The laughter had
not been repeated for some time before they negotiated
the last glacier gash, and they were beginning
to wonder if their ghostly guide had deserted them.</p>
<p>It was Toma who saw it first&mdash;the form of a
human being sitting erect against a snow bank across
the white level of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look. Somebody there!&rdquo; Toma whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it must be a dead man,&rdquo; faltered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life,&rdquo; gritted Corporal McCarthy.
&ldquo;See him move. That fellow&rsquo;s tied and that fellow
is Sandy McClaren!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s eyes suddenly testified as to the accuracy
of the policeman&rsquo;s statement. &ldquo;Sandy!&rdquo; he almost
shrieked, starting to run toward him.</p>
<p>But the iron hand of Corporal McCarthy dragged
him back as if he had been merely a pillowful of
feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out there!&rdquo; cried the Corporal. &ldquo;This is a
trap you can bet and we&rsquo;ll go slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy apparently was gagged, for though he had
begun to wriggle, he made no sound with his mouth
except an almost inaudible gurgle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Corporal McCarthy was pawing in the snow for
something. Dick finally saw what he was after&mdash;a
stone. The policeman finally found one that was
quite heavy. He raised this above his head and to
Dick and Toma&rsquo;s amazement, threw it out upon the
snow between them and Sandy.</p>
<p>The boys expected the stone to bound and roll a
little way, but to their horror, as the stone struck it
disappeared and, following it, more than twenty
square feet of snow caved downward with a rustling
hiss and disappeared into a fathomless black void.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s gasp of dismay was followed by a piercing
voice from the shadows of the boulders behind them.
It was the voice that had done the laughing, but
this time it did not laugh but cried out in an expression
of rage and disappointment.</p>
<p>Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s rifle was at his shoulder
when the sound reached his ears, but there was
nothing to shoot at&mdash;only the ghastly moonlight of
the polar night, and the inky shadows. The policeman
raised his rifle and shook it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat you that time&mdash;you half-breed devil!&rdquo; his
big voice pealed out across the desolate wastes. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m praying you&rsquo;ll come down here and fight it out
where I can get a bead on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no answer, and a moment later
the Corporal turned back to the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Clever trap,&rdquo; he explained in an undertone.
&ldquo;But I had my suspicions, and as soon as I saw
Sandy out there in plain sight, I knew there was a
nigger in the fence. That was a snow bridge we
came pretty near busting through. Wind built it up
across this gorge. Now we&rsquo;ve got to get at the
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calling across the chasm, they explained to Sandy
that they must find some other place to cross over
to him. Hurriedly making their way to the left
along the treacherous brink, which for many yards
was bridged by the frail snow drift, they finally
came to a narrow place and one by one leaped over
with their snowshoes in their hands. It took them
but a few moments to strap on their snowshoes again
and run to Sandy. In a trice they had slashed his
bonds and yanked the gag from his mouth.</p>
<p>With a joy they could not express, Dick and
Sandy embraced, whereupon Sandy&rsquo;s story came
tumbling from his lips by fits and starts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Briefly, it was this: About half way to Moonshine
Sam&rsquo;s igloo, following the beaten path, he had
heard stealthy footsteps coming toward him. In
the gloom he could see nothing, and so he had
stopped, waiting for some sign that the person was
a friend or an enemy. Then, without warning, a
smothering fur robe had been thrown over him and
he was lifted up in strong arms and carried away.
At a distance from the igloos far enough so that
his cries for help would not bring his friends, Sandy&rsquo;s
captors had put him on his feet, and taken off
the robe. They then had taken his knife away from
him and had thrown it away. Sandy had then been
compelled to accompany the men on foot. When his
eyes had grown accustomed to the dimly starlit
night, he had managed to recognize Mistak among
the three, and had found out that they were leaving
bits of fur behind them to mark their trail. Sandy
had not been able to fathom their purpose in leaving
such a plain trail, nor had he been fully aware of
the nature of the cunning trap laid by Mistak when
the outlaw had left him bound and gagged against
a snowdrift, after a long roundabout journey among
a network of deep gorges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what it was all about till I saw
you three stop out there in front of me, and throw
that stone,&rdquo; Sandy concluded. &ldquo;I guess I made a
pretty good bait for that trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pretty near went right on after you, too,&rdquo;
shivered Dick, recalling their narrow escape, &ldquo;but
Corporal McCarthy was wise enough to see through
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s be getting back to camp,&rdquo; the policeman
interrupted them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a lot farther from
home than we ought to be. If a storm catches us
before we get in there&rsquo;s no telling whether we&rsquo;ll
ever get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure beginning to wish it really was home
we were going back to,&rdquo; groaned Sandy. &ldquo;In two
days I&rsquo;ve only had one chunk of walrus meat to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Buck up, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick replied cheerfully, as they
set out on the back trail. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back at camp
before you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dick was wrong. Before they were on the
trail an hour, a bank of clouds that had been hovering
in the north, spread out fan-like across the stars
and presently the moon was blotted out as if some
giant hand had taken it from the sky.</p>
<p>With not even the stars to light their way, the
four travelers stumbled blindly along, until Corporal
McCarthy ordered them to halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t keep on like this,&rdquo; said the Corporal
grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get so far off the back trail that
we&rsquo;ll never find our way back. The only thing we
can do is build an igloo and wait for the moon to
come out again. Let&rsquo;s hope a storm don&rsquo;t come
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After blundering about in the darkness, which
was so thick they could cut it with a knife, they
finally located a drift which was solid enough and
large enough for the cutting of snow blocks for an
igloo. It was a poor snow house they erected largely
by their sense of touch, but it served the purpose.
Hovering inside their makeshift shelter they waited
silently for the clouds to disperse, praying for fair
weather to continue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Yet the supreme power that governed the capricious
whims of the mighty ice cap seemed deaf to
their supplications for a half hour after the igloo
had been completed the temperature began to fall
alarmingly. A wind sprang up out of the northeast,
just a whisper at first, like the vast, mournful
sigh of a melancholy spirit, then rapidly it grew
louder, by gusts and fits, until a thirty mile an hour
gale was sweeping the snow wastes with the fury of
a stampeded lion. The wind sought out every niche
and cranny in the hastily erected igloo, and through
the heavy garments of the shivering refugees it cut
like so many tiny knives. Futilely, they tried to stop
up the holes where the wind seeped in while the
gale laughed and howled and whistled, as if in mad
glee at the discomfiture it was causing the shivering
mortals.</p>
<p>In the grip of the terrible cold, the four kept from
falling into that dreadful drowsiness which signals
death by freezing, by beating themselves and each
other with their numbed arms. The fur rims of
their parkas became heavy with icicles formed by
moisture from their mouth. Their eyelashes froze
together from the watering of their eyes. With each
breath it seemed red hot irons had been thrust down
their throats and liquid fire loosed in their lungs.
For extreme cold has much the same sensation of
extreme heat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Two hours they fought a losing fight, then the
capricious gods of the north changed their minds
and the wind began to lay. Almost imperceptibly
at first, each gust a little weaker than the last, until
finally, they all crept out of the igloo to find a vast
silence pervading the ghostly land. Cold and pale,
the Arctic moon now lighted their way, for the
clouds had been herded southward by the passing
polar wind.</p>
<p>The temperature had risen a little when all four
set out on the return trail, now almost blotted out
save where the wind had struck it squarely and had
blown the loose snow away around the packed snowshoe
tracks.</p>
<p>In his weakened condition Sandy had almost succumbed
to the cold, and part of the way they had
to carry the gritty young Scotchman.</p>
<p>Thus they stumbled into the village of igloos
hours later, lungs burning from the frost, bodies
numb and prickling in a dozen places.</p>
<p>No more had they arrived than they found their
troubles were not over.</p>
<p>Corporal Thalman met them with disturbing
news, as soon as they had stumbled into an igloo and
lighted an oil heater.</p>
<p>Moonshine Sam had escaped during the storm!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">UNDER AN ARCTIC MOON</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay awake,&rdquo; Corporal Thalman said
bitterly, in explanation of Moonshine Sam&rsquo;s escape.
&ldquo;I was the only one to stand the watches, because I
couldn&rsquo;t trust any of the Eskimos to stick to their
post. It&rsquo;s a wonder he didn&rsquo;t kill me while I was
helpless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought he wanted to stay with us for protection
from the vengeance of Mistak,&rdquo; Corporal
McCarthy said impatiently. &ldquo;How was he acting up
to the time you fell asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed to change his mind,&rdquo; replied the
other officer. &ldquo;I recall him mumbling about the gallows,
and about knowing he&rsquo;d be hung if he was
taken back by the police. I think he intends either
to try to rejoin Mistak, or make his way south
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Corporal McCarthy&rsquo;s voice was expressive
of an inward, suppressed rage, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to
bring him back! If we don&rsquo;t Mistak will kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Quickly, the Corporal gave his instructions. He
and Corporal Thalman were to set out after Moonshine
Sam as soon as they had eaten. Dick, Sandy
and Toma were to remain in camp, and as soon as
Constable Sloan and Sipsa came in with the searching
parties, the boys were to report to them the
escape of the outlaw and pass on orders for their
aid in retaking the prisoner.</p>
<p>A half hour later, the two Corporals departed
from the village of igloos with a day&rsquo;s provisions,
and a camp stove, packed on their backs. Not long
after they had gone the searching parties straggled
in, discouraged and half frozen from the blizzard
which they, too, had been caught in.</p>
<p>Alone among the Eskimos, the three boys treated
their frost bites with snow and alcohol rubs, fed
themselves on musk-ox steaks, and when again
fairly comfortable, became impatient at inaction.
It was far worse to sit in idleness than to get out
and do something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go hunting,&rdquo; suggested Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than sitting here in this igloo waiting
for something to happen,&rdquo; Sandy rejoined. &ldquo;I
believe I&rsquo;d go crazy in this awful silence if I had to
sit around and wiggle my thumbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma seemed willing enough to stay behind and
take care of things in the absence of the boys, and so
Dick and Sandy started out without him, carrying
only their rifles and hunting knives, for they dared
not go far away from camp. They knew that, while
they had weathered one brief blizzard, they could
not expect to be so fortunate next time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>Looking for musk-oxen, the boys climbed the
high moraine east of the base camp and followed
the top of the ridge southward until they reached
an arm of the glacier on the other side.</p>
<p>They had gone upward of two miles when they
came suddenly upon the print of a sealskin Arctic
boot in the snow. The boys stopped and studied
the track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be made by any of the policemen, or
Sipsa either,&rdquo; said Dick with bated breath. &ldquo;They
all had snowshoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it can&rsquo;t be Mistak either,&rdquo; Sandy observed.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be traveling on snowshoes too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s just about got to be Moonshine Sam,&rdquo;
Dick spoke slowly.</p>
<p>Again they bent over the boot track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see it was made before or during the
blizzard,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s partly drifted full of
snow. Let&rsquo;s look for other tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several feet away from the first, on the other
side of a long, low, snowdrift they found the next
track. It was raised up out of the snow, the wind
having sucked away the loose flakes all around it.
Another and another they found, as the trail grew
hotter, but the tracks seemed to have been made by
a person wandering aimlessly here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain it&rsquo;s Moonshine Sam now,&rdquo; Dick
breathed. &ldquo;His tracks show how crazily he was
going, blinded by the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Hastening on, the boys presently came to fresher
footprints, made, obviously, after the wind had laid.
The tracks were now sunken in deep snow, revealing
how, from lack of snowshoes, the man had
floundered along.</p>
<p>They had followed the fresher tracks for about
half a mile, when to their surprise another trail,
made by snowshoes, joined and followed the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who that could be,&rdquo; Sandy spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s only one man, so it can&rsquo;t be the policemen,
unless they&rsquo;ve divided up. I hardly think they&rsquo;d
do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Mistak or some of his men,&rdquo; was
Sandy&rsquo;s conjecture. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d better
go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life we&rsquo;re not going back!&rdquo; Dick
said determinedly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to
strike a hot trail, and believe me, we&rsquo;re going to
stick to it. But I do wish we could get in touch with
the policemen. Look around, Sandy, and see if you
can&rsquo;t see someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a careful scanning of the bleak snowfields
failed to disclose any sign of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to keep on alone I guess,&rdquo; Dick said
finally.</p>
<p>Once more they started out on the double trail,
their senses on the alert for a sight or sound of those
they followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Fresher and fresher became the trail, for the man
on snowshoes was rapidly overtaking whoever
he pursued, provided that was what he had been
doing, and according to signs the man in boots had
increased his pace to a floundering run as if he
wanted to get away from someone.</p>
<p>The boys came to the brow of a long incline,
slanting to a level tundra, and down the slope saw
two men, surprisingly close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let
either of them see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping down in the snow, the boys watched
an interesting chase. The man on snowshoes was
rapidly overtaking another who plunged along
hampered by sinking at every step.</p>
<p>Sandy clutched Dick by the arm and said hoarsely,
fearfully: &ldquo;That man in front is Moonshine Sam&mdash;sure
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can bet the fellow on snowshoes is
Mistak,&rdquo; came back Dick confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to fight!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy.
&ldquo;What if someone&rsquo;s killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help it, Sandy. It&rsquo;s their fight. We&rsquo;re
risking our lives if we try to stop it, without killing
one of them ourselves, and you know we couldn&rsquo;t
kill in cold blood. Oh, if the policemen were only
here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Tensely the boys watched the two draw nearer
together. When a hundred yards separated them,
Moonshine Sam turned, shook his fists over his
head, and let out a loud yell. Then he started
back. The man was going to fight now that he was
in a corner.</p>
<p>Mistak carried only a spear as a long distance
weapon. The boys divined that he and his band
had long since run out of ammunition for the few
firearms they possessed.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy held their breath as they saw
the white Eskimo draw back his arm and pose for
a throw. An instant Mistak bent backward, still as
a statue, then his body and arm snapped forward
simultaneously, like a catapult. The spear shot
forward in a low arc toward Moonshine Sam, half
as swift as an arrow.</p>
<p>Moonshine Sam fell flat in the snow none too
soon, and the whizzing weapon buried itself in the
snow a few feet beyond him. Like a flash Moonshine
Sam leaped to his feet, wheeled and ran for
the spear, pawing frantically in the snow, he at last
found the buried spear.</p>
<p>Mistak was making for the other outlaw at a
spraddling run, as Moonshine Sam aimed the spear
to throw it back. But he had a running target that
was purposely bobbing up and down and zig-zagging.</p>
<p>Then the spear flashed through the moonlight, a
streak of potent death, but the white outlaw was not
an expert spear thrower. The weapon missed Mistak
by several feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to close in,&rdquo; Dick whispered, burying
his fingers into Sandy&rsquo;s arm in his excitement.</p>
<p>Both outlaws obviously had drawn knives now.
Moonshine Sam must have stolen one before he
escaped from the igloo. They circled warily. First
one then the other advanced, Mistak moving more
swiftly on his snowshoes, though his footwork was
ponderous enough.</p>
<p>Moonshine Sam finally ceased trying to outmaneuver
his opponent, and stood stolidly, knee
deep in the snow&mdash;waiting.</p>
<p>Then Mistak struck, like a flash. But Moonshine
Sam was not so inexpert with a knife as he was with
a spear. The white outlaw parried Mistak&rsquo;s swift
thrust and sent him reeling backward, almost falling
when one snowshoe caught on its mate. But the
white Eskimo quickly regained his feet, and began
to circle again for an opening.</p>
<p>For several minutes Mistak kept Moonshine Sam
turning about, then he rushed in again. The knives
clashed and held. It was strength against strength
now as each outlaw strove to bring his knife downward
for a fatal thrust. Weaving and straining,
sometimes locked together as still as statues, the outlaws
struggled, while the perspiration came out and
froze on the faces of the hidden boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>At last the two men broke away from each other
for a brief second, but this time Moonshine Sam
didn&rsquo;t wait for Mistak to attack. He lunged forward
out of the snow and caught the white Eskimo by
his knife, arm and waist. Three times the attacking
outlaw&rsquo;s knife flashed up and down in the moonlight,
and the boys knew Mistak had been wounded.
Then the clenched two rolled to the snow, struggling
like fiends. Minute after minute they fought, Mistak
now handicapped by his snowshoes instead of
aided by them. At last the white Eskimo was pinned
upon his back and Moonshine Sam&rsquo;s knife began
slowly to descend against the strength of the outlaw
leader&rsquo;s left hand clutching the knife wrist.</p>
<p>With the end almost in sight, the boys heard a
distant shout, and looking north of them, saw four
men bearing down the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police! The police!&rdquo; cried Dick, as he got
to his feet and began shouting and waving to them.</p>
<p>Two of the four men ran toward the struggling
outlaws, but they were too late to stop the impending
tragedy. Moonshine Sam&rsquo;s knife found its mark,
and he arose, shaking the snow from his clothes,
leaving a still form in the snow.</p>
<p>It was not until then that the victorious outlaw
discovered the two policemen descending upon him.
With a startled shout, he started to run away, then
aware that he could never get away alive, he shook
his fists defiantly at his pursuers, and with a hoarse
yell, plunged his knife into his own breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s beaten the law!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, horrified
by this grim justice of the frozen north. &ldquo;Come on,
Sandy, let&rsquo;s go down and join the policemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found Corporals McCarthy and Thalman
inspecting the two silent forms on the tundra when
they arrived on the scene of the battle. Both outlaws
were dead beyond a shadow of doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Corporal McCarthy looked up from the
silent face of Mistak, &ldquo;the game is over, and for
once, the mounted got licked&mdash;but it took death to
do it,&rdquo; he concluded grimly, briefly ordering that
two graves should be hollowed out in the snow, and
the bodies interred.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy found a little later, that the two
who had accompanied the Corporals were the last
of Mistak&rsquo;s band, an Indian and an Eskimo&mdash;both
with their hands tied behind them. The corporals
explained that they had run across them starving in
an igloo, after they had deserted Mistak. The outlaws
had given up without a struggle, morosely accepting
a fate they considered less terrible than that
which the awful northland might have dealt out to
them.</p>
<p>Though the shadow of the recent tragedy darkened
their spirits, it was an infinitely relieved party
that set out on the trail back to the supply base.
With every step that carried them further from
those still forms in their snow graves, their hearts
grew lighter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>On the way back they sighted Constable Sloan
and Sipsa, and hailed them with the tragic news.
The two joined them on the return journey, and already
the talk was of the trip back to God&rsquo;s country
in the spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lordy, how glad I am it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; Sandy grew
steadily more cheerful. &ldquo;My, what I can tell Uncle
Walter when I see him again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About all I&rsquo;m going to be interested in,&rdquo; Dick
broke in, &ldquo;for a few days, after we get back to your
uncle&rsquo;s post, is going to be good, roast turkey, with
sage dressing&mdash;pumpkin pie&mdash;apple sauce&mdash;nice
brown pan gravy&mdash;stewed cranberries&mdash;coffee with
sugar and cow&rsquo;s cream&mdash;chocolate pudd&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s exclamation expressed how his
stomach rebelled against such fruitless tantalization.
&ldquo;If you say another word about food, I&rsquo;m going to
die right here of starvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick slapped Sandy on the back and laughed, then
arm in arm they went on together.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The last of the long night passed slowly but steadily
away, and the spring came to gladden the hearts
of Dick and Sandy.</p>
<p>March 4th they saw the sun again, and never did
they greet the rising of that great orb with such
heartfelt joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>A day later they started southward, Sipsa and the
other Eskimos accompanying them to the mainland,
which they reached safely in kayacks. Leaving all
camp paraphernalia that they did not need, with the
Eskimos, they left the children of the north happy
and sorry to see their white friends go. Dick and
Sandy, too, felt a pang in their hearts as Sipsa&rsquo;s
smiling face vanished out of their ken, probably
never to be seen again. But as they left the Arctic
behind them, under the spring sun, all feelings of
regret at parting were replaced by one great and
growing joy&mdash;they were going home!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">A PROPOSITION</span></h2>
<p>It was a gala day at the trading post of Walter
McClaren, Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Factor; a day for feasting
and story-telling. For Dick Kent and Sandy McClaren
had come back from the far north.</p>
<p>In the big dining room the factor&rsquo;s old Indian
housekeeper and cook hovered about a long table
loaded with the best products of her culinary art.
Her stoic face could scarcely conceal the pleasure
she derived from witnessing the seemingly insatiable
appetites of her master&rsquo;s nephew and his chum.</p>
<p>Walter McClaren, a big florid Scotchman, sat at
the head of the table beaming upon the boys and recalling
his own boyhood days. He believed boys
should have plenty of excitement and outdoor experience,
and as he listened to the ceaseless recounting
of their recent adventures with the Eskimos, his
smile grew broader and broader, while the roast
turkey and dressing vanished along with sweet
potatoes, pumpkin pie, stewed cranberries, and chocolate
pudding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;We just caught the boat going south,&rdquo; Dick said
between bites. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;d been a day later we&rsquo;d have
been held up more than a month before another boat
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you fellows have been pretty lucky,&rdquo; rejoined
Sandy&rsquo;s uncle. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known for a minute
what I was sending you into, I&rsquo;d never let you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad we went,&rdquo; returned Sandy. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t go through it again for anything, but just
the same after it&rsquo;s all over, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade the
experience for&mdash;for a commission in the mounted
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That just reminds me that from what Inspector
Dunbar says, you fellows are slated for some kind
of a special medal or something for your services in
the Arctic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medals!&rdquo; Dick was alive in an instant, his half-eaten
turkey drum stick forgotten for the moment.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, Uncle Sandy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it must be a fact, if Inspector Dunbar said
so,&rdquo; replied the factor. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not just exactly
what I want to discuss with you fellows,&rdquo; continued
the old Scotchman, knocking out his pipe on a leg
of his chair and refilling it. &ldquo;I have a proposition
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A proposition!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick. &ldquo;What is it
now. A lost mine? Buried treasure? Outlaws?
Missing men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up. Tell us what it really is,&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed,
alive with interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to give me a chance to talk
then,&rdquo; Mr. McClaren came back patiently. &ldquo;And
Dick hasn&rsquo;t guessed what the proposition is. It&rsquo;s not
as profitable as lost mines or buried treasure, nor as
dangerous as hunting outlaws, but more entertaining
than hunting missing men. There&rsquo;s money in it,
some excitement and a chance to make good with one
of the greatest organizations in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy were begging now, for their interest
certainly had been intrigued. So engrossed
had they become in what the proposition was going
to be that they even forgot to eat, sitting there with
their mouths open and loaded fork half suspended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proposition is this,&rdquo; the factor stated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
thinking of starting a branch fur-trading post near
Great Slave Lake and I need some enterprising ambitious
men to help out. There&rsquo;s some bad competition&mdash;a
free trader in that region, but I think he&rsquo;ll be
some careful what he does to any of the Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay Company men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, do you want us to be fur-traders?&rdquo; Sandy
interrogated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size of it, boys,&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s uncle
replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending one man up who is an expert
on furs, and there&rsquo;ll be a mounted police post
established there. You boys can help with the trading,
and can hunt and fish and trap all you like. It
will be a real vacation from the hard job you had in
the Arctic.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beginning to look good to me already,&rdquo; Dick
spoke eagerly. &ldquo;What do you say, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for it if you are,&rdquo; replied Dick&rsquo;s chum, &ldquo;and
we can take Toma along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Indian who had remained impassive
during the conversation, brightened at Sandy&rsquo;s
words and his dusky face was split by a huge grin.
He had been afraid of being left out of the plans
and was now much relieved.</p>
<p>The factor signaled the old Indian housekeeper.
&ldquo;Pour us all some more coffee,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to propose a toast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy exchanged glances. What was
the toast going to be, they wondered.</p>
<p>When the coffee cups were all filled and creamed
and sugared, the old factor stood up and the boys
did likewise. Lifting his cup high over his head,
Mr. McClaren said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the health of Dick Kent, fur trader,
and may he never buy a pelt that sheds or trade a
rifle for a black cat&rsquo;s hide thinking it&rsquo;s a black fox
skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys burst out laughing, but touched cups
with Sandy&rsquo;s uncle and drank the toast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let me give a toast,&rdquo; Dick spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Mr. McClaren agreed.</p>
<p>Assuming a gallant pose, Dick upraised his cup
and said solemnly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to Factor McClaren the best sport in the
world and the jolliest bachelor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Walter McClaren&rsquo;s turn to laugh, and his
big voice shook the very log beams of the dining
room.</p>
<p>Sandy was about to propose another toast, when
there came a knock at the door.</p>
<p>The factor motioned the housekeeper to open the
door. All eyes turned to see the visitor. Into the
living room of the cabin stamped a tall man, resplendent
in the scarlet coat of the mounted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there, Corporal McCarthy,&rdquo; shouted the
boys, recognizing the leader of their recent expedition.</p>
<p>The Corporal paused in the doorway leading into
the dining room. He returned the boys&rsquo; greetings
in kind, then drew himself up to attention, proudly
displaying the medals on his chest, and saluted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector Dunbar requests the presence of Dick
Kent and Sandy McClaren,&rdquo; announced the Corporal
solemnly and impressively, &ldquo;for presentation of
special decorations in reward for their Arctic services
with the Royal Northwest Mounted Police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick whistled, Sandy gasped, and both blushed,
then Corporal McCarthy came around and shook
their hands, slapping them on the back heartily, while
Sandy&rsquo;s uncle added his sincere congratulations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what about Toma?&rdquo; Dick asked the Corporal,
when he had recovered from his embarrassment.
&ldquo;Is he left out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S-s-h. The Inspector has a surprise for him,&rdquo;
whispered the Corporal. &ldquo;A brand new 22 High
Power rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So did the King&rsquo;s policemen make happy hearts
of their loyal and daring young servants.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
